##You have a set of 3 light switches outside a closed door. One of them controls the light inside the room. With the door closed from outside the room, you can turn the light switches on or off as many times as you would like.
You can go into the room - one time only - to see the light. You cannot see the whether the light is on or off from outside the room, nor can you change the light switches while inside the room.
No one else is in the room to help you. The room has no windows

> ON 1st switch and let it be ON for 10 min and then OFF 
> Now ON 2nd switch and go inside the room if the bulb is lighted then the correct switch is 2nd and if the bulb if not lighted but it is hot (feel it by touching) then it is the 1st switch otherwise the 3rd switch
----------------------------------
##You have 10 Jars filled with marbles. Each marble weighs 10 gm, except one Jar which contains defective marbles which weighs 9 gm. 
Given a scale to weigh, How do you find Jar with defective marbles in just one measurement. Here scale is modern day electronic scale to measure weight.

> Take 1 marble from jar 1,2 marbles from jar 2, 3 marbles from jar 3 …….. 10 marbles from jar 10. 
> Now weigh these marbles on the weighing machine. Let’s say the sum is 549 grams.

> Now ideally the sum should be 550 grams(1*10 + 2*10 + 3*10 …………….10*10) if all the marbles were of same weight. This means that one marble is defective.
> So this marble will be from jar 1 as we have taken just 1 marble from jar 1.So this means that jar 1 contains the marbles weighing 9 grams.

Similarly if the weight shown by the machine is 548 grams that means that the jar 2 contains the defective marbles and so on.

##There are 40 people in a room. They shake each other's hands once and 
only once. How many handshakes are there altogether?

> 40 people shake hands, so each person shakes 39 hands. 
The first person shakes 39 hands, 
-the second person shakes 38 hands, 
- the third person shakes 37 hands, and so on

39 + 38 + 37 + 36 + ... + 3 + 2 + 1

##An bacteria grows at the speed that it will double its volume per minute. If you put it in a jar, it will fill the jar in one hour. how long will it take to fill a half of the jar?

> We know that the bacteria doubles its volume in one minute. 
> So, if it took the jar 1 hour to be full, we know that it it will take (1 hour - 1 min) i.e 59 mins for the jar to be half.

##If one and a half teenagers, eat one and a half pizzas in one and a half days, how many pizzas can 9 teenagers eat in 3 days

Ans- 
Give them more time, they eat more pizzas. 
Give them more friends, they eat more pizzas. 

The time was double (3 days / 1.5 days) and the people was 6x times more (9 / 1.5), thus the number of pizzas should be 2 * 6 times more. That is: 1.5 pizzas * 2 * 6 = 18 

Answer: 18 pizzas

->1.5 teenagers eat 1.5 pizzas in 1.5 days... 
=>1.5 teenagers eat 3 pizzas in 3 days... 
=>3 teenagers eat 6 pizzas in 3 days... 
=>9 teenagers eat 18 pizzas in 3 days...

##3 Baskets, with label Apple Orange and Mixed. All the lables are incorrect. Pick up one fruit from one of the 3 baskets and find the correct labels for these 3 baskets.

> Pick one fruit from the basket labeled "mixed". If apple comes out, tag it to "apple". Change the basket labeled as "apple" to "orange" and the basket labeled as "orange" to "mixed". 
> Otherwise if orange comes out, tag it to "orange". Change the basket labeled as "orange" to "apple" and the basket labeled as "apple" to "mixed".

##There are 27 coins and a two-pan balance. All coins has same weight except for one, which is heavier than all others. All coins looks identical. What is the minimum number of weighing required to certainly find out heavier coin?

Key here is to understand that 27 is cube of 3, which means it will take minimum 3 weighing attempts to find defective coin. Let's assume defective coin is heavier than normal coins, now divide 27 coins into group of 9. Out of three groups, weigh two of them in balance. The group with heavier coin, will go down, which means you can discard two groups right that time. Now further divide those 9 coins into 3 groups of 3 coins, and repeat the process, this will give you a group of 3 coins, now divide them into group of 1 coins, at this time (which is third weighing attempt), you will find out exactly which coin is defective. This puzzle can be generalized further, e.g. if interviewer gives you 8 coins or 64 coins

## 8 identical looking balls. One of them is heavier than the rest of the 7 (all the others weigh exactly the same). How to find heaviest ball in lowest no. of iteration.
1. select {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} => if balance then in 7,8 will be heaviest
2. else if either {1,2,3} or {4,5,6} will be heaviest then if {1,2,3} is heaviest 
	2a. {1} or {2} or {3} will be heaviest.

## You are give two red balls, two green balls and two yellow balls. One ball from each color is heavier than the other one. All the heavier balls weigh the same and all the lighter balls weigh the same. You are only provided with a weighing balance. How many tries would it take to identify which one is heavier and which one is lighter?

Answer: Let’s label the balls R1, R2 (Red ones), G1, G2 (Green ones) and Y1, Y2 (Yellow ones).

First weigh R1, G1 on one side and R2, Y1 on the other.

If they are equal, we know that one of G1 or Y1 is heavy. We can just weigh them both and find out which one is heavier. If G1 is heavy, the heavier set is {G1, R2, Y2} and the others are lighter. If Y1 is heavy, the heavier set is {G2, R1, Y1}.

If R1, G1 is heavy, we know that either G1 is heavy or Y1 is light. We proceed to weigh G1, Y1 with G2, Y2. If they are equal, G1 is the heavy one. The heavier set is {G1, Y2, R1}. If G1, Y1 is heavy, G1 and Y1 are both heavy. The heavier set is {Y1, G1, R1}. If G2, Y2 is heavy, G2 and Y2 are both heavy. The heavier set is {R1, G2, Y2}.

If R2, Y1 is heavy, we know that either Y1 is heavy or G1 is light. This is similar to the case above. Try to work it out yourself before continuing with the solution. Weigh G1, Y1 with G2, Y2. If they are equal, Y1 is heavy. The heavier set is {Y1, R2, G2}. If G1, Y1 is heavy, G1 and Y1 are both heavy. The heavier set is {G1, Y1, R2}. If G2, Y2 is heavier, G2 and Y2 are both heavy. The heavier set is {G2, Y2, R2}.

Therefore, in any of these cases, we only need two tries with the balance.

Question: You have 50 red marbles, 50 blue marbles and 2 jars. One of the jars is chosen at random and then one marble will be chosen from that jar at random. How would you maximize the chance of drawing a red marble? What is the probability of doing so? All 100 marbles should be placed in the jars.

Answer: Seems tricky at first right? Given that the number of red and blue marbles are the same, you would tend to think that the odds are 50-50. You would try different combinations, such as 25 of each colored marble in a jar or putting all red marbles in one jar and all the blue in the other. You would still end up with a chance of 50%.

So lets think of a better way to distribute the marbles. What if you put a single red marble in one jar and the rest of the marbles in the other jar? This way, you are guaranteed at least a 50% chance of getting a red marble (since one marble picked at random, doesn’t leave any room for choice).  Now that you have 49 red marbles left in the other jar, you have a nearly even chance of picking a red marble (49 out of 99).

So let’s calculate the total probability.

P( red marble ) = P( Jar 1 ) * P( red marble in Jar 1 ) + P( Jar 2 ) * P( red marble in Jar 2 )
P( red marble ) = 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 49/99
P( red marble ) = 0.7474

Thus, we end up with ~75% chance of picking a red marble.

##Two persons are walking into a railway tunnel. Upon crossing 2/3rd of the tunnel, they saw train is coming from opposite direction. Each person ran for a different end of tunnel with speed of 10 km per hour. Fortunately, both persons escaped from the tunnel just right time i.e.. at the time train would have run through them. Assuming train was running with a constant speed and both persons reacted immediately, Find out speed of train.

Answer to Question No 3:
Let Length of tunnel = x
When they saw the train, distances to the ends of tunnel: x/3 and 2x/3
Time taken (TT) by 2x/3 person = TT by train to reach the first end + TT by the train inside the tunnel
Time taken (TT) by 2x/3 person = TT by x/3 person + TT by the train inside the tunnel
ie (2x/3)/10 = (x/3)/10 + x/Y (time = distance/velocity: Y = train speed)
2/30 = 1/30 + 1/Y
Y = 30 Km/Hr

========================================
You are given 2 eggs.
* You have access to a 100-storey building.
* Eggs can be very hard or very fragile means it may break if dropped from the first floor or may not even break if dropped from 100 th floor.Both eggs are identical.
* You need to figure out the highest floor of a 100-storey building an egg can be dropped without breaking.
* Now the question is how many drops you need to make. You are allowed to break 2 eggs in the process

Let x be the answer we want, the number of drops required.

So if the first egg breaks maximum we can have x-1 drops and so we must always put the first egg from height x. So we have determined that for a given x we must drop the first ball from x height. And now if the first drop of the first egg doesn’t breaks we can have x-2 drops for the second egg if the first egg breaks in the second drop.

Taking an example, lets say 16 is my answer. That I need 16 drops to find out the answer. Lets see whether we can find out the height in 16 drops. First we drop from height 16,and if it breaks we try all floors from 1 to 15.If the egg don’t break then we have left 15 drops, so we will drop it from 16+15+1 =32nd floor. The reason being if it breaks at 32nd floor we can try all the floors from 17 to 31 in 14 drops (total of 16 drops). Now if it did not break then we have left 13 drops. and we can figure out whether we can find out whether we can figure out the floor in 16 drops.

Lets take the case with 16 as the answer

1 + 15 16 if breaks at 16 checks from 1 to 15 in 15 drops
1 + 14 31 if breaks at 31 checks from 17 to 30 in 14 drops
1 + 13 45 .....
1 + 12 58
1 + 11 70
1 + 10 81
1 + 9 91
1 + 8 100 We can easily do in the end as we have enough drops to accomplish the task


Now finding out the optimal one we can see that we could have done it in either 15 or 14 drops only but how can we find the optimal one. From the above table we can see that the optimal one will be needing 0 linear trials in the last step.

So we could write it as

(1+p) + (1+(p-1))+ (1+(p-2)) + .........+ (1+0) >= 100.

Let 1+p=q which is the answer we are looking for

q (q+1)/2 >=100

Solving for 100 you get q=14.
So the answer is: 14
Drop first orb from floors 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99, 100... (i.e. move up 14 then 13, then 12 floors, etc) until it breaks (or doesn't at 100).

Is Your Husband a Cheat?

Question: A certain town comprises of 100 married couples. Everyone in the town lives by the following rule: If a husband cheats on his wife, the husband is executed as soon as his wife finds out about him. All the women in the town only gossip about the husbands of other women. No woman ever tells another woman if her husband is cheating on her.  So every woman in the town knows about all the cheating husbands in the town except her own. It can also be assumed that a husband remains silent about his infidelity. One day, the mayor of the town announces to the whole town that there is at least 1 cheating husband in the town. What do you think happens?

Answer: Stumped? Let’s solve this methodically. Say there was only 1 cheating husband in the town. There will be 99 women who know exactly who the cheater is. The 1 remaining woman, who is being cheated on, would have assumed there are no cheaters. But now that the mayor has confirmed that there is at least one cheater, she realizes that her own husband must be cheating on her. So her husband gets executed on the day of the announcement.

Now let’s assume there are 2 cheaters in the town. There will be 98 women in the town who know who the 2 cheaters are. The 2 wives, who are being cheated on, would think that there is only 1 cheater in the town.  Since neither of these 2 women know that their husbands are cheaters, they both do not report their husbands in on the day of the announcement. The next day, when the 2 women see that no husband was executed, they realize that there could only be one explanation – both their husbands are cheaters. Thus, on the second day, 2 husbands are executed.

Through induction, it can be proved that when this logic is applied to n cheating husbands, they all die on the n th day after the mayor’s announcement.
