##Explain quick sort and merge sort algorithms.

> QUICK SORT employs the ‘divide and conquer’ concept by dividing the list of elements into two sub elements.

The process is as follows:

1. Select an element, pivot, from the list.
2. Rearrange the elements in the list, so that all elements those are less than the pivot are arranged before the pivot and all elements those are greater than the pivot are arranged after the pivot. Now the pivot is in its position.
3. Sort the both sub lists – sub list of the elements which are less than the pivot and the list of elements which are more than the pivot recursively.

> MERGE SORT: A comparison based sorting algorithm. The input order is preserved in the sorted output.

Merge Sort algorithm is as follows:
1. The length of the list is 0 or 1, and then it is considered as sorted.
2. Other wise, divide the unsorted list into 2 lists each about half the size.
3. Sort each sub list recursively. Implement the step 2 until the two sub lists are sorted.
4. As a final step, combine (merge) both the lists back into one sorted list.
=====================================
##What is Bubble Sort and Quick sort?
> BUBBLE SORT: The simplest sorting algorithm. 
- It involves the sorting the list in a repetitive fashion. 
- It compares two adjacent elements in the list, and swaps them if they are not in the designated order. 
- It continues until there are no swaps needed. This is the signal for the list that is sorted. 
- It is ALSO CALLED AS COMPARISON SORT as it uses comparisons.

QUICK SORT: The best sorting algorithm which implements the ‘divide and conquer’ concept. 
- It first divides the list into two parts by picking an element a ’pivot’. 
- It then arranges the elements those are smaller than pivot into one sub list and the elements those are greater than pivot into one sub list by keeping the pivot in its original place.
