######## PROGRAMMING PARADIGM ##########
>it is a fundamental style of computer programming. 
> There are four main paradigms: 
1. IMPERATIVE, 
> you tell the compiler what you want to happen, step by step.

2. DECLARATIVE, 
> you write code that describes what you want, but not necessarily how to get it (declare your desired results, but not the step-by-step)
Ex - var results = collection.Where( num => num % 2 != 0);

3. FUNCTIONAL (which is considered a subset of the declarative paradigm) and 

4. OBJECT-ORIENTED
