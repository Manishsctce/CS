- SSH keys provide a more secure way of logging into a virtual private server with SSH than using a password alone. 
- While a password can eventually be cracked with a brute force attack, SSH keys are nearly impossible to decipher by brute force alone. 
- Generating a key pair provides you with two long string of characters: a public and a private key. 
- You can place the public key on any server, and then unlock it by connecting to it with a client that already has the private key. 
When the two match up, the system unlocks without the need for a password. You can increase security even more by protecting the private key with a passphrase.

##Create the RSA Key Pair
ssh-keygen -t rsa

##Store the Keys and Passphrase
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa):
> Press enter here, saving the file to the user home
