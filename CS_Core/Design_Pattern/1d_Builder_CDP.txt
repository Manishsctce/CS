######## BUILDER DESIGN PATTERN #########
GoF Definition:
> It ALLOWS FOR THE STEP-BY-STEP CREATION OF COMPLEX OBJECTS using the correct sequence of actions. 
- The construction is controlled by a director object that only needs to know the type of object it is to create.

Intent

> Defines an instance for creating an object but letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate
> Refers to the newly created object through a common interface
> Builder design pattern uses the Factory Builder pattern to decide which concrete class to initiate in order to build the desired type of object

> Builder pattern was introduced TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS WITH FACTORY AND ABSTRACT FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN WHEN THE OBJECT CONTAINS A LOT OF ATTRIBUTES.
=======================================
## 3 MAJOR ISSUES WITH FACTORY AND ABSTRACT FACTORY DESIGN PATTERNS 
- used WHEN THE OBJECT CONTAINS A LOT OF ATTRIBUTES.

1. Too Many arguments to pass from client program to the Factory class that can be error prone 
- because most of the time, the type of arguments are same and from client side its HARD TO MAINTAIN THE ORDER of the argument.

2. Some of the parameters might be optional but in Factory pattern, we are FORCED TO SEND ALL PARAMETERS AND OPTIONAL PARAMETERS NEED TO SEND AS NULL.

3. If the object is heavy and its creation is complex, then all that complexity will be part of Factory classes that is confusing.

> We can solve the issues with large number of parameters by providing a constructor with required parameters and then different setter methods to set the optional parameters. 
- The problem with this approach is that the Object state will be inconsistent until unless all the attributes are set explicitly

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### Difference between Builder and Abstract Factory design pattern ?

> The only difference is builder provides more control over the object creation process and thatâ€™s it.
> abstract factory pattern is the answer to "WHAT" and the builder pattern to "HOW".

########## JAVA EXAMPLES ##############
- java.lang.StringBuilder#append() (unsynchronized)
- java.lang.StringBuffer#append() (synchronized)
- java.nio.ByteBuffer#put() (also on CharBuffer, ShortBuffer, IntBuffer, LongBuffer, FloatBuffer and DoubleBuffer)
- javax.swing.GroupLayout.Group#addComponent()
- All implementations of java.lang.Appendable
- java.util.stream.Stream.Builder
=======================================
## Benefits and ADVANTAGES OF BUILDER PATTERN

> Undoubtedly, the number of lines of code increase at least to double in builder pattern, 
- but the effort pays off in terms of design flexibility and much more readable code. 

> The PARAMETERS TO THE CONSTRUCTOR ARE REDUCED and are provided in highly readable method calls.
- Builder pattern also helps minimizing the number of parameters in constructor and thus there is no need to pass in null for optional parameters to the constructor.

############ EXAMPLE : 1 ##############

- Private constructor and have static builder class of the main class

public class User 
{
    //All final attributes
    private final String firstName; // required
    private final String lastName; // required
    private final int age; // optional
    private final String phone; // optional
    private final String address; // optional
 
    private User(UserBuilder builder) {
        this.firstName = builder.firstName;
        this.lastName = builder.lastName;
        this.age = builder.age;
        this.phone = builder.phone;
        this.address = builder.address;
    }
 
    //All getter, and NO setter to provde immutability
    public String getFirstName() {
        return firstName;
    }
    public String getLastName() {
        return lastName;
    }
    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
    public String getPhone() {
        return phone;
    }
    public String getAddress() {
        return address;
    }
 
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "User: "+this.firstName+", "+this.lastName+", "+this.age+", "+this.phone+", "+this.address;
    }
 
    public static class UserBuilder 
    {
        private final String firstName;
        private final String lastName;
        private int age;
        private String phone;
        private String address;
 
        public UserBuilder(String firstName, String lastName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }
        public UserBuilder age(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }
        public UserBuilder phone(String phone) {
            this.phone = phone;
            return this;
        }
        public UserBuilder address(String address) {
            this.address = address;
            return this;
        }
        //Return the finally consrcuted User object
        public User build() {
            User user =  new User(this);
            validateUserObject(user);
            return user;
        }
        private void validateUserObject(User user) {
            //Do some basic validations to check 
            //if user object does not break any assumption of system
        }
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    User user1 = new User.UserBuilder("Lokesh", "Gupta")
    .age(30)
    .phone("1234567")
    .address("Fake address 1234")
    .build();
 
    System.out.println(user1);
 
    User user2 = new User.UserBuilder("Jack", "Reacher")
    .age(40)
    .phone("5655")
    //no address
    .build();
 
    System.out.println(user2);
 
    User user3 = new User.UserBuilder("Super", "Man")
    //No age
    //No phone
    //no address
    .build();
 
    System.out.println(user3);
}
 
Output: 
User: Lokesh, Gupta, 30, 1234567, Fake address 1234
User: Jack, Reacher, 40, 5655, null
User: Super, Man, 0, null, null
