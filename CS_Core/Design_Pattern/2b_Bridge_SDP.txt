######## BRIDGE DESIGN PATTERN ########
GoF Definition:
> Decouple the abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Bridge design Pattern?

> It is a structural design pattern.
> Decouple the abstraction from its implementation
> USES COMPOSITION OVER INHERITANCE.

> IT HELPS TWO INCOMPATIBLE CLASSES TO WORK TOGETHER
=======================================
########## IMPORTANT POINTS ###########

> this pattern decouples implementation class and abstract class by providing a bridge structure between them.

> Creates two different hierarchies. One for abstraction and another for implementation.
> AVOIDS PERMANENT BINDING by removing the dependency between abstraction and implementation.
> We create a bridge that coordinates between abstraction and implementation.
> Abstraction and implementation can be extended separately.
=======================================
########### JAVA EXAMPLES #############

> new LinkedHashMap(LinkedHashSet.
<K>, List<V>) which returns an unmodifiable linked map which doesn't clone the items, but uses them. 
- The java.util.Collections#newSetFromMap() and singletonXXX() methods however comes close.
=======================================
### ELEMENTS OF BRIDGE DESIGN PATTERN ###

1. ABSTRACTION 
– core of the bridge DP and defines the crux. Ex - Shape[ac] 
- Contains a reference to the implementer. Ex - Shape[ac] have DrawAPI[i]

2. REFINED ABSTRACTION 
– Extends the abstraction takes the finer detail one level below. Ex - Circle 
- Hides the finer elements from implemetors.

3. IMPLEMENTER 
– This interface is the higer level than abstraction. Just defines the basic operations. Ex - DrawAPI[i]

4. CONCRETE IMPLEMENTATION 
– Implements the above implementer by providing concrete implementation. Ex - RedCircle and GreenCircle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is difference between Adaptor and bridge pattern ?

The major difference between adapter and bridge is when they are used. 
> Adapter is used when two incompatible interfaces have to be unified together, ie., adapter is a result of existing incompatibilities. 
- But bridge is used when we actually need to separate interface from implementation.

public interface DrawAPI {
   public void drawCircle(int radius, int x, int y);
}
---------------------------------
public class RedCircle implements DrawAPI {

      System.out.println("Drawing Circle[ color: red, radius: " + radius + ", x: " + x + ", " + y + "]");
   }
}
---------------------------------
public class GreenCircle implements DrawAPI {
   @Override
   public void drawCircle(int radius, int x, int y) {
      System.out.println("Drawing Circle[ color: green, radius: " + radius + ", x: " + x + ", " + y + "]");
   }
}
---------------------------------

   protected DrawAPI drawAPI;

   public void draw() {
      drawAPI.drawCircle(radius,x,y);
   }
}
