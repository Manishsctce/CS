####### Open System Interconnection (OSI) #######
> It is a model defines a networking framework to implement protocols in seven layers. 
> It doesn't perform any func in the networking process. It is a conceptual framework.


##7 OSI Model Layers
>To Remember:  All People Seam to need Data Processing

## Physical (Layer 1)
> It is the layer which describe bit stream i.e electric impluse, light or radio signal which carry data through the network.
> It describe the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier, including defining cables, cards and physical aspects

## Data Link (Layer 2)
> The data link layer is divided into two sub layers: 
A. Media Access Control (MAC) sub layer controls how a computer on the network gains access to the data and permission to transmit it. 
B. Logical Link Control (LLC) layer controls frame synchronization, flow control and error checking.

### Network (Layer 3)
> it provides switching and routing technologies, creating logical paths, known as virtual circuits, for transmitting data from node to node. 
- Routing and forwarding are functions of this layer, as well as addressing, internetworking, error handling, congestion control and packet sequencing.

## Transport (Layer 4)
> OSI Model, Layer 4, provides transparent transfer of data between end systems, or hosts, and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. It ensures complete data transfer.


Session (Layer 5)
This layer establishes, manages and terminates connections between applications. The session layer sets up, coordinates, and terminates conversations, exchanges, and dialogues between the applications at each end. It deals with session and connection coordination.

Presentation (Layer 6)
This layer provides independence from differences in data representation (e.g., encryption) by translating from application to network format, and vice versa. The presentation layer works to transform data into the form that the application layer can accept. This layer formats and encrypts data to be sent across a network, providing freedom from compatibility problems. It is sometimes called the syntax layer.


Application (Layer 7)
OSI Model, Layer 7, supports application and end-user processes. Communication partners are identified, quality of service is identified, user authentication and privacy are considered, and any constraints on data syntax are identified. Everything at this layer is application-specific. This layer provides application services for file transfers, e-mail, and other network software services. Telnet and FTP are applications that exist entirely in the application level. Tiered application architectures are part of this layer.
