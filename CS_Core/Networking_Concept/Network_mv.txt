socket s = New socket(hostname, portno)
inputstream is = s. getInputStream
Two type oof IP address 
1. Static - Which can be configure manually 
2. Dynamic - configure automatically and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configure Protocol)  enable. 

Classful IP address types:
1 A -  for government - (0 - 127)  represent network and other 24 bits represent host 
id.  Here 0 &127 is for special purpose. 0 is for this /my network and 127 for looping back,  for checking NIC 

2. B - for medium company -  (128- 191) 16 bit represent network and other 16 bits represent host 
id i.e local id 

3. C - for small company -  (192 - 223)  represent network and other 8 bits represent host 

4. D - for multicasting 
5 E. -  for future purpose 

===========================
> Kerberos is a secure method for authenticating a request for a service in a computer network.

IPCONFIG
> displays the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway for all adapters.

Syntax
ipconfig [/all] [/renew [Adapter]] [/release [Adapter]] [/flushdns] [/displaydns] [/registerdns] [/showclassid Adapter] [/setclassid Adapter [ClassID]]

######## What is a Subnet Mask? #########
An IP address has two components, the network address and the host address. 
> A subnet mask separates the IP address into the network and host addresses (<network><host>). 
> Subnetting further divides the host part of an IP address into a subnet and host address (<network><subnet><host>) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
###### CIDR - Classless Inter Domain Routing ###########
> It was invented to keep the Internet from running out of IP Addresses

> With CIDR, a network of IP addresses is allocated in 1-bit increments as opposed to 8-bits in classful network. 
> The use of a CIDR notated address can easily represent classful addresses (Class A = /8, Class B = /16, and Class C = /24). 
> The number next to the slash (i.e. /8) represents the number of bits assigned to the network address. 

The example shown above can be illustrated with CIDR as follows:

   216.3.128.12, with subnet mask of 255.255.255.128 is written as
   216.3.128.12/25

   Similarly, the 8 customers with the block of 16 IP addresses can be
   written as:

############# What is a MAC Address?############# 


MAC, Media Access Control, address is a globally unique identifier assigned to network devices, and therefore it is often referred to as hardware or physical address. MAC addresses are 6-byte (48-bits) in length, and are written in MM:MM:MM:SS:SS:SS format. The first 3-bytes are ID number of the manufacturer, which is assigned by an Internet standards body. The second 3-bytes are serial number assigned by the manufacturer.

MAC layer represents layer 2 of the TCP/IP (adopted from OSI Reference Model), where IP represents layer 3. MAC address can be thought of as supporting hardware implementation whereas IP address supports software implementation. MAC addresses are permanently burned into hardware by hardware manufacturer, but IP addresses are assigned to the network devices by a network administrator. DHCP relies on MAC address to assign IP addresses to network devices.

How do I find a MAC address of network device?

Operating Systems support various command-line and GUI utilities to allow users to find MAC address of the system. On Unix variants including Solaris and Linux support "ifconfig -a", "ip link list" or "ip address show" command that displays MAC address of the network device among other useful information. Windows including NT, 2000, XP and 2003 support "ipconfig /all" command that displays MAC address. On a MacOS, one can find MAC address by opening "System Preferences", then selecting "Network".
