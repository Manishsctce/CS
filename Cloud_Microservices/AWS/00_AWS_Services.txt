### Advantages of AWS ###
> FLEXIBILITY
- Customer can focus on core business and still can use new IT features

> COST EFFECTIVENESS
- It doesn't requires any upfront investment, long-term commitment, and minimum expense when compared to traditional IT infrastructure

> Scalability/Elasticity
- autoscaling and elastic load balancing techniques are automatically scaled up or down, when demand increases or decreases respectively

> SECURITY
- AWS provides end-to-end security and privacy to customers.
- AWS ensures the 3 aspects of security, i.e., Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user's data.
=======================================
###### AWS GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE ######
> following components makes the AWS infrastructure:

1. AVAILABILITY ZONES AS A DATA CENTER
- It can be anywhere in country/city 

- we can have multiple servers, switches, load balancing, firewalls. The things which interact with the cloud sits inside the data centers.

> An AVAILABILITY ZONE CAN BE A SEVERAL DATA CENTERS, BUT IF THEY ARE CLOSE TOGETHER, THEY ARE COUNTED AS 1 AVAILABILITY ZONE.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. REGION
> It is a geographical area. EACH REGION CONSISTS OF 2 MORE AVAILABILITY ZONES.
- It is a collection of data centers which are completely isolated from other regions.
- AZ within regions are interconnected through redundant and isolated metro fibers(low-latency dedicated networks)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. EDGE LOCATIONS

> EDGE LOCATIONS ARE MORE THAN REGIONS. 
> It is the endpoints for AWS USED FOR CACHING CONTENT.

> It consist of CloudFront, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- Currently, there are over 150 edge locations.
- It is not a region but a small location that AWS have. 
- It is mainly LOCATED IN MOST OF THE MAJOR CITIES to distribute the content to end users with REDUCED LATENCY.
- For example, some user accesses your website from Singapore; then this request would be redirected to the edge location closest to Singapore where cached data can be read.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4. REGIONAL EDGE CACHE

> AWS announced a new type of edge location in November 2016, known as a Regional Edge Cache.

> Regional Edge cache lies between CloudFront Origin servers and the edge locations.

> IT HAS A LARGE CACHE THAN AN INDIVIDUAL EDGE LOCATION.
- Data is removed from the cache at the edge location while the data is retained at the Regional Edge Caches.
- When the user requests the data, then data is no longer available at the edge location. Therefore, the edge location retrieves the cached data from the Regional edge cache instead of the Origin servers that have high latency.
=======================================
## AWS Account Identifiers

> AWS assigns two types of unique ID to each user's account:

1. AWS account ID
> It is a 12-digit number which can be used to construct Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)

2. Canonical user ID
>  It is 64-DIGIT HEXADECIMAL ENCODED a 256-bit number.
> It is USED in an Amazon S3 bucket policy FOR CROSS-ACCOUNT ACCESS means that AWS account can access the resources in another AWS account. 
- For example, if you want AWS account access to your bucket, you need to specify the canonical user ID to your bucket's policy.
