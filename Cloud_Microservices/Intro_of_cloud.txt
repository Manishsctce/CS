## What is Cloud Computing?

> It can be defined as delivering computing power( CPU, RAM, Network Speeds, Storage OS software) a service over a network (usually on the internet) rather than physically having the computing resources at the customer location.
---------------------------------------
## What are the advantages of using cloud computing?

> Lower IT infrastructure and computer costs for users
> Improved performance
> Fewer Maintenance issues
> Instant software updates
> Improved compatibility between Operating systems
> Backup and recovery
> Performance and Scalability
> Increased storage capacity
> Increase data safety
---------------------------------------
## Explain different models for deployment in cloud computing?
> The different deployment models in cloud computing are
a) Private Cloud
b) Public Cloud
c) Community Cloud
d) Hybrid Cloud
---------------------------------------
## What are the security aspects provided with cloud?

a) Identity management: 
- It authorizes the application services

b) Access control: 
- permission has to be provided to the users so that they can control the access of another user who is entering into the cloud environment.

c) Authentication and Authorization: 
- Allows only the authorized and authenticated user only to access the data and applications
---------------------------------------
#### Cloud Computing Services

1. Software as a Service(SaaS)
> It is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network (internet)

2. Platform as a Service(PaaS)
> It provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services. This service is hosted in the cloud and accessed by the users via internet.
Example - Cloud Foundary, Google Cloud Platform(GCP), PCF etc

3. Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
> IaaS provider provides OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
Example - AWS
---------------------------------------
## Explain what are the different modes of software as a service (SaaS)?

a) Simple multi-tenancy :  
- In this each user has independent resources and are different from other users, it is an efficient mode.

b) Fine grain multi-tenancy:  
- In this type, the resources can be shared by many but the functionality remains the same.
---------------------------------------
## what is the difference between elasticity and scalability in cloud computing?

> Elasticity is a system’s ability to shrink or expand infrastructure resources potentially as required
- It is featured with pay-as-you-expand or pay-per-use services 

> scalability includes the system’s ability to grow workload sizes within pre-existing hardware, software and other related infrastructure in the absence of impacting performance

## Difference bet Cloud Computing and Grid Computing
---------------------------------------
## Mention some open source cloud computing platform databases?

> The open source cloud computing platform databases are

a) MongoDB
b) CouchDB
c) LucidDB
