## What do you mean by Microservices?
> Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the SOA style 
- It structures an app as a collection of loosely coupled services. 
- here services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. 

## ADVANTAGE OF MICROSERVICES
> it improves modularity. 
- This makes the application easier to understand, develop, test, and become more resilient to architecture erosion.

> It parallelizes development by enabling small autonomous teams to develop, deploy and scale their respective services independently.

> It also allows the architecture of an individual service to emerge through continuous refactoring.
> Microservice-based architectures enable continuous delivery and deployment.
