##ORA-12560: TNS:protocol adaptor error

Go to the windows machine that hosts the Oracle database server
Go to Start -> Run -> Services.msc in windows. Locate OracleService (here OracleServiceORCL) and click on "Start" to start the oracle database service (if not already running)
Once it is up and running, from the command prompt run the following:

tnsping < tnsalias >

(tnsalias entry you can find it in tnsnames.ora file)
-------------------------
## Network Adapter error
The Network Adapter exception is caused because:

The database host name or port number is wrong (OR)
The database TNSListener has not been started. The TNSListener may be started with the lsnrctl utility.
Try to start the listener using the command prompt:

Click Start, type cmd in the search field, and when cmd shows up in the list of options, right click it and select ‘Run as Administrator’.
At the Command Prompt window, type lsnrctl start without the quotes and press Enter.
Type Exit and press Enter.
