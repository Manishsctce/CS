> Angular 9 brought us some new options for dependency injection

> root is the option that was added a while back in Angular 6. Angular CLI uses that option as its default when you create a new service with the command: ng generate service

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
@Injectable({  
   providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService { 
}

> root means that your service is going to be a global singleton that can be injected anywhere in your application.

#Injectable provided in ‘platform’
> using platform means service is now a global singleton at the platform-level, and is shared between all of the Angular applications on webpage.
- useful when multiple Angular applications on one web page
- it allow us to share information between multiple Angular apps running in the same browser tab.

#Injectable provided in ‘any’
> With any, Angular will provide a unique instance of your service in every module that injects it.

=======================================

// or in tsconfig.json:
“angularCompilerOptions”: { “preserveWhitespaces”: false}`

> Angular Universal State Transfer API and DOM Support

> Compiler Improvements: 
- it improved the support of incremental compilation of an app.

> HttpClient: until Angualar 4.3 @angular/HTTP was been used which is now depreciated and in Angular 5 a new module called HttpClientModule is introduced which comes under @angular/common/http package.

> Few new Router Life-cycle Events being added in Angular 5: In Angular 5 few new life cycle events being added to the router and those are:
ActivationStart, ActivationEnd, ChildActivationStart, ChildActivationEnd, GuardsCheckStart, GuardsCheckEnd, ResolveStart and ResolveEnd.

> Release date 2017
> Lot of performance improvement is made to reduce size of AOT compiler generated code
> TypeScript 2.1 and 2.2 compatibility
