## What is Angular ? 

> It is a UI framework for building mobile and desktop web applications. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## what are the features of Angular?

> Two-Way Data Binding
- This is the coolest feature of the Angular. 
- Data binding is automatic and fast. changes made in the View is automatically updated in the component class and vice versa

> Powerful Routing Support
- The Angular Powerful routing engine loads the page asynchronously on the same page enabling us to create a Single Page Applications.

> Expressive HTML
- Angular enables us to use programming constructs like if conditions, for loops, etc to render and control how the HTML pages.

> Modular by Design
- Angular follows the modular design. You can create Angular modules to better organize and manage our codebase

> Built-in Back End Support
- Angular has built-in support to communicate with the back-end servers and execute any business logic or retrieve data

> Active Community
- Angular is Supported by google and has a very good active community of supporters. This makes a lot of difference as your queries are quickly resolved.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the differences between AngularJs & Angular?

> AngularJS, it is based on MC architecture
- Angular  , is based on Service/Controller

> AngularJS, uses use JavaScript to build the application
- Angular  , Introduced the typescript to write the application

> AngularJS, Based on controllers concept
- Angular  , is a component based UI approach

> AngularJS, Not a mobile friendly framework
- Angular  , Developed considering mobile platform

> AngularJS, Difficulty in SEO friendly application development
- Angular  , Ease to create SEO friendly applications


> Support for ES6
- Angular is completely written in Typescript and meets the ECMAScript 6 specification. 

> Components are new controllers
- In AngularJS we had Controllers. 
- In Angular Controllers are replaced with Angular Components. 

> Directives
- AngularJS had a lot of directives.
- Angular also has directives, but with a different syntax. It has a * before the directive name indicating it as a structural directive

- style directives like ng-style, ng-src & ng-href are all gone. These are now replaced by property binding HTML elements to the class properties

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the building blocks of Angular? 

> The Angular application is made using the following: 

- Modules
- Component
- Template
- MetaData
- Data Binding
- Directives
- Services
- Dependency Injection
- Routing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is NPM?

> It is Node Package Manager
> It is used to install libraries, Packages & applications from Public repositories.
- we use to install Angular, Typescript, Webpack, SystemJS and any other packages/modules required by our app, otherwise need to install manually. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Why Module Loader Required?

> Module loader takes a group of modules with their dependencies and merges them into a single file in the correct order. This process is called as Module bundling.
- for use it bundle multiple JS file into a single file, which is helpful to download at client side 

> Webpack is a powerful module loader
- It can bundles any kind of file: JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, SASS, LESS, images, HTML, fonts etc.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the use of 'ng serve'?

> 'ng serve' does build our app but does not save the compiled application to the disk. It saves it in memory and starts the development server.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is a Bootstrapping

> Bootstrapping is a technique of initializing or loading our Angular application

angular.json ->  src/main.ts -> AppModule -> AppComponent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How to make production ready build? 

> 'ng build' : build and copy the output files to the dist folder
> 'ng build --prod' : build and distribute the app for production

> in dist folder's index.html

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>GettingStarted</title>
  <base href="/">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
</head>
<body>
  <app-root></app-root>
 
  <script src="runtime-es2015.js" type="module"></script>
  <script src="runtime-es5.js" nomodule defer></script>
  <script src="polyfills-es5.js" nomodule defer></script>
  <script src="polyfills-es2015.js" type="module"></script>
  <script src="styles-es2015.js" type="module"></script>
  <script src="styles-es5.js" nomodule defer></script>
  <script src="vendor-es2015.js" type="module"></script>
  <script src="vendor-es5.js" nomodule defer></script>
  <script src="main-es2015.js" type="module"></script>
  <script src="main-es5.js" nomodule defer></script></body>
</html>

> All these files have two versions es5 (for older browsers) & es2015(es6) is for modern browser 
- nomodule attribute tells the modern browser to ignore the script and do not load it.

> When above index.html is loaded then all lib are loaded 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the entry point of angular application?

> '[root]/angular.json' is the app entry point 
- it direct angular bootstrapper to load 'src/main.ts'

##main.ts
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
 
import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';
 
if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

// loads the root module  
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is platformBrowserDynamic ? 

> platformBrowserDynamic is the module, which is responsible for loading the Angular app in the desktop browser.
- platformNativeScriptDynamic is used for mobile device 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is component decorators?

> main objectives of decorators is to add some metadata to the class that will tell Angular how to process a class. 
- Decorators are functions that modify JavaScript classes. 
- Angular has many decorators that attach metadata to classes so that it knows what those classes mean and how they should work.

In Angular 4, we will have following options to configure.

1. selector:
- define the name of the HTML element in which our component will live.

2. template or templateUrl:
- It can be inline string or link an external html file. 
- It allows us to tie logic from our component directly to a view.

3. styles:
- the styles array for our specific component. 
- We can also link external CSS by styleUrls.

4. directives:
- another component directives we want to use inside our components.

5. providers:
- This is the place we are passing the services that we need insider our components.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is compilation in Angular 4? And what are the types of compilation in Angular 4?

> There is actually only one Angular compiler.
>  There are two types of compilation Angular 4 provides:

1. JUST-IN-TIME (JIT) COMPILATION: 
- This is a standard development approach which compiles Typescript and html files in the browser at runtime, as the application loads. 
- It is great but has disadvantages. Views take longer to render because of the in-browser compilation step. 
- App size increases as it contains angular compiler and other library code that wonâ€™t actually need.

2. AHEAD-OF-TIME (AOT) COMPILATION: 
- With AOT, the compiler runs at the build time and the browser downloads only the pre compiled version of the application. 
- The browser loads executable code so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first. 
- This compilation is BETTER THAN JIT BECAUSE OF FAST RENDERING, SMALLER APPLICATION SIZE, SECURITY AND DETECT TEMPLATE ERRORS EARLIER.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Angular Material?

> It is UI component library
> It helps in creating attractive, consistent and fully functional web pages as well as web app.

> It does so while following modern web design principles, including browser portability and graceful degradation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Angular Universal? 

> It is a server-side rendering module for Angular app in various scenarios.
> This is a community driven project and available under @angular/platform-server package

> Recently it is integrated with Angular CLI. 
=======================================
## What is Transpiling in Angular?

> It is the process of converting the typescript into javascript (using Traceur, a JS compiler). 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What does tree-shakeable mean?

> It means that if a service ends up not being used by our app, 
- the Angular compiler is going to remove that service from production build, which results in a smaller, faster application.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the Pipes? 

> This feature is used to change the output on the template; 
- something like changing the string into uppercase and displaying it on the template. 
- It can also change Date format accordingly. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Differentiate between ng-Class and ng-Style.

> In ng-Class, loading of CSS class is possible; whereas, 
- in ng-Style we can set the CSS style.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is an AsyncPipe in Angular? 

When an observable or promise returns something, we use a temporary property to hold the content. Later, we bind the same content to the template. With the usage of AsyncPipe, the promise or observable can be directly used in a template and a temporary property is not required 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Attribute Vs Property

> Both are not the same.
> Attribute are define by HTML 
- Property are define by DOM(Document Object Model)


> Attribute initialize DOM properties and then they are done.
- it value doesn't change once they are initialzed.

> Property values however can change

####### Decorators ########
> It is a feature of TypeScript and are implemented as functions. 
- The name of the decorator starts with @ symbol following by brackets and arguments, since decorators are just functions in TypeScipt.

> It is simply functions that return functions. 
- These functions supply metadata to Angular about a particular class, property, value, or method...
> Decorators are invoked at runtime.
> Decorators allow you to execute functions. For example @Component executes the Component function imported from Angular 7.

Some Common Decorators...
- @NgModule() to define modules...
- @Component() to define compents...
- @Injectable() to define services...
- @Input() and @Output() to define properties...that send and receive data from the dom.
- There are many built-in decorators available in Angular...and many properties on each decorator

## TYPES OF DECORATORS
1. Class decorators, : e.g. @Component and @NgModule
2. Property decorators : for properties inside classes, e.g. @Input and @Output
3. Method decorators : for methods inside classes, e.g. @HostListener
4. Parameter decorators : for parameters inside class constructors, e.g. @Inject

> Each decorator has a unique role

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What happens if you use script tag inside template?

> Angular recognizes the value as unsafe and automatically sanitizes it, 
- which removes the <script> tag but keeps safe content such as the text content of the <script> tag. 
- This way it eliminates the risk of script injection attacks. 
- If you still use it then it will be ignored and a warning appears in the browser console. 
- Let's take an example of innerHtml property binding which causes XSS vulnerability,

export class InnerHtmlBindingComponent {
  // For example, a user/attacker-controlled value from a URL.
  htmlSnippet = 'Template <script>alert("0wned")</script> <b>Syntax</b>';
}
