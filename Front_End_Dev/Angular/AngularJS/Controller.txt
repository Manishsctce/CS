########### CONTROLLERS ############
## What are controllers in AngularJS?
> it is javascript function that are USED TO PROVIDE DATA AND LOGIC TO HTML.
> it act as an interface between server and html.
> CONTROLLERS responsibility to initialize the data that the view needs to display
>  $scope as an object that links Controller to the View

AngularJS Controllers are used to:
> Set up initial state of the $scope object, and
> Add behavior to the $scope object.


> ng-controller attribute tells AngularJS what controller to use with this view
Ex - 
index.html
<div ng-controller="HelloController" >
    <h2>Hello {{helloTo.title}} !</h2>
</div>


<!-- This is controller --> 
<script>
angular.module("myapp", [])
    .controller("HelloController", function($scope) {
        $scope.helloTo = {};
        $scope.helloTo.title = "World, AngularJS";
    });
</script>


> "myapp" module is used to register HelloController 
> $scope parameter passed to the controller function is the "model". 
- The controller function adds a "helloTo" JavaScript object, and in that object it adds a "title" field.
