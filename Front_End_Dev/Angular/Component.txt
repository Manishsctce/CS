## What is Component?

> It is class that interact with the .html file of the component, which gets displayed on the browser.

> It is the basic building block of Angular, which means that an Angular app is a collection of components, and one component is responsible for handling one view or part of the view.

> A component encapsulates the data, the HTML markup, and the logic for a View. You can create as many components as required.

> It is a simple typescript class which contains the following things,
- Typescript Class
- HTML template/Template URL
- @Component decorator with metadata.

> Every Angular app has at least 1 component that is used to display the
data on the View.
> The component contains metadata like animation effect, style to apply the components, template, input-output, import etc.
> These are the main building blocks of an Angular application.
> When we create any component, it gets defined in NgModule.
> Angular is a component-based architecture which allows us to work on smaller and more maintainable pieces that can also be used in different places.
