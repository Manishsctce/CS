############### DIRECTIVE #############

> directives are used to manipulate the DOM. 
- By using Angular directives, we can change the appearance, behavior or a layout of a DOM element. It also helps you to extend HTML.

> A directive is a class, which we create using the @Directive class decorator. 
- It contains the metadata and logic to manipulate the DOM

> directives can be classified in 3 categories based on how they behave:

1. Component Directives
> It is used in main class. 
- They contain the detail of how the component should be processed, instantiated and used at runtime.

2. Structural Directives
> It start with a * sign. 
> These directives are used to manipulate and change the structure of the DOM elements. 
> For example, *ngIf directive, *ngSwitch directive, and *ngFor directive.

3. Attribute Directives
> It is used to change the look and behavior of the DOM elements. 
- For example: ngClass directive, and ngStyle directive etc.

> It is used add or remove HTML Elements according to the expression. 
- The expression must return a Boolean value. 
- If the expression is false then element is removed, otherwise element is inserted.
