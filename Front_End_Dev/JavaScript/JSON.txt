JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
> It is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
> It is an easier-to-use alternative to XML.
> JSON syntax is a subset of JavaScript syntax.


#### JSON Syntax Rules ####
JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax:

> Data is in name/value pairs
- it consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value Ex - "firstName":"Manish Agrawal"

> Data is separated by commas

> Curly braces hold objects
- JSON objects can contain multiple name/values pairs
Ex- {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}

> Square brackets hold arrays
Ex - "employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}, 
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"}, 
    {"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Jones"}
]
- "employees" is an array containing three objects

## JSON values can be:
- A number (integer or floating point)
- A string (in double quotes)
A Boolean (true or false)
An array (in square brackets)
An object (in curly braces)
null

## JSON Files ##
> The file type for JSON files is ".json"
> The MIME type for JSON text is "application/json"


> JavaScript function JSON.parse(text) can be used to convert a JSON text into a JavaScript object.
