############# TYPE SCRIPT ##############
## What is TypeScript?

> It is JavaScript for application-scale development.
> It is an open-source pure OOP lang.
> It is developed and maintained by Microsoft under Apache 2 license.
> It was developed by Anders Hejlsberg, who is also one of the core members of the development team of C# language.
> It was first released in the month of 1st October 2012 and was labeled version 0.8.
> It is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

> It is both a language as well as a set of tools.
> It is a language for application-scale JavaScript development.

> It can be executed on any browser, any Host, and any Operating System.
- It is not directly run on the browser. It needs a compiler to compile and generate in JavaScript file.

> It source file is in ".ts" extension. 
- We can use any valid ".js" file by renaming it to ".ts" file.

> It is the ES6 version of JavaScript with some additional features.

## Why use TypeScript?

> It is used because of Strong Type system. 
- Previously, JavaScript was NOT Type based that's why the development of large app is difficult as we don't know any error prehand.
- TS provides the error-checking feature at compilation time. 

> It supports OOP features such as classes, interfaces, inheritance, generics, etc.
> It supports all JavaScript libraries because it is the superset of JavaScript.

> It has definition file with .d.ts extension to provides a definition for external JavaScript libraries.

> It supports the latest JavaScript features including ECMAScript 2015.
- It gives all the benefits of ES6 plus more productivity.

## What are the Disadvantage of TypeScript over JavaScript? 

> TypeScript takes a long time to compile the code.
> TypeScript does not support abstract classes.
> If we run the TypeScript application in the browser, a compilation step is required to transform TypeScript into JavaScript.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

> Each line of instruction is called a statement. Semicolons are optional in TypeScript.
- if single line can contain multiple statements. However, these statements must be separated by a semicolon.

 To compile the file

######### Compiler Flags ########
> enable you to change the behavior of the compiler during compilation.
