addClass() - Adds one or more classes to the selected elements
removeClass() - Removes one or more classes from the selected elements
toggleClass() - Toggles between adding/removing classes from the selected elements
css() - Sets or returns the style attribute

.addClass() - adds one or more class names to the selected elements
$(selector).addClass(classname,function(index,oldclass))


.removeClass() - removeClass
