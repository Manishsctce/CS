> It is based on the concept of Pay-As-You-Go

> 4 levels of AWS premium support
Basic, Developer, Business and Enterprise.

> 1hr is the maximum response time for a Business Level 'production down' Support Case

### Advantages of AWS ###
> FLEXIBILITY
- Customer can focus on core business and still can use new IT features

> COST EFFECTIVENESS
- It doesn't requires any upfront investment, long-term commitment, and minimum expense when compared to traditional IT infrastructure

> Scalability/Elasticity
- autoscaling and elastic load balancing techniques are automatically scaled up or down, when demand increases or decreases respectively

> SECURITY
- AWS provides end-to-end security and privacy to customers.
- AWS ensures the 3 aspects of security, i.e., Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user's data.
=======================================

=======================================
## AWS Account Identifiers

> AWS assigns two types of unique ID to each user's account:

1. AWS account ID
> It is a 12-digit number which can be used to construct Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)

2. Canonical user ID
>  It is 64-DIGIT HEXADECIMAL ENCODED a 256-bit number.
> It is USED in an Amazon S3 bucket policy FOR CROSS-ACCOUNT ACCESS means that AWS account can access the resources in another AWS account. 
- For example, if you want AWS account access to your bucket, you need to specify the canonical user ID to your bucket's policy.

=======================================
> AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on 5 pillars

1. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE : 
- The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

2. SECURITY : 
- The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
- Monitoring and using alerts using CloudTrail and CloudWatch

3. RELIABILITY : 
- The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, DYNAMICALLY ACQUIRE computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
- NON-OVERLAPPING PRIVATE IP addr is the Reliability pillar 

4. PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY : 
- The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
- design using elasticity to meet demand is the Performance Efficiency pillar. 

5. COST OPTIMIZATION : 
- The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.

## What defines Serverless ?

> No server to provision or manage
> Automatic scale with usage 
> Never pay for idle 
> Availablility and fault tolerance built-in 

SERVERLESS EXAMPLE - 
Compute - Lambda, Fargate, 
Storage - Aurora, DynamoDB, S3 
Integration - API Gateway, SQS, Glue, SNS, StepFunctions, AppSync

Not Serverless - Kinesis, EC2

=======================================
##### Disaster Recovery with AWS ######

## DISASTER RECOVER(DR)
- it is the process of designing an architecture that is able to recover from any disaster situation within a stipulated time. 
- The cost of DR planning is inversely proportional to the time required to recover the infrastructure. 

## 2 critical aspects DR plan
1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 
- This defines the time within which business processes should be recovered from downtime.

2. Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 
- This defines the acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time

> DR approach can be broadly categorized in 4 models:
- based on the spectrum of complexity and time 
1. Backup and restore (most economical but time-taking)
2. Pilot light
3. Warm standby
4. Multi-site (expensive but fast)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##### Backup and restore ######
> it require periodically backing up critical data on tape drive and keeping it in a safe and secured place for later use. 
- In the event of disaster, the backed-up data can be restored as needed.
- RPO/RTO is in hours
- Use for : Lower priority use cases
- Lowest cost

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
######## Pilot Light ##########
>> the minimal DR version with the most critical components of the env is always kept running in parallel with the production env. 

- RPO/RTO is in 10s of minutes
- Use for : Core services
- Cost is higher than 'Backup & Restore'

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
######## Warm Standby #########
> It extends the pilot light DR model. 
> In the case of the pilot light model, you need to create additional instances or resources to match the size of the primary environment. 
- warm standby keeps a fully functional DR setup with a minimum fleet of instances with the minimum possible size of instances.

> In the event of any disaster, DR setup is scaled up to match the primary site and traffic is failed over to the DR setup

- RPO/RTO is in minutes
- Use for : Business critical services
- Cost is higher than 'pilot light'

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
######### MULTI-SITE ##########
> It is also called Hot Standby
> infrastructure of the same size is always in sync and running at multiple locations. 
- These multiple locations can be between a physical data center and AWS or between various AWS regions. 
- In some practices, the secondary site keeps handling partial traffic in parallel to the production environment

- RPO/RTO is in real time (Automatic failover)
- Use for : Most critical services
- Cost is higher than 'warm standby'
