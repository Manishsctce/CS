### Advantages of AWS ###
> FLEXIBILITY
- Customer can focus on core business and still can use new IT features

> COST EFFECTIVENESS
- It doesn't requires any upfront investment, long-term commitment, and minimum expense when compared to traditional IT infrastructure

> Scalability/Elasticity
- autoscaling and elastic load balancing techniques are automatically scaled up or down, when demand increases or decreases respectively

> SECURITY
- AWS provides end-to-end security and privacy to customers.
- AWS ensures the 3 aspects of security, i.e., Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user's data.
=======================================

=======================================
## AWS Account Identifiers

> AWS assigns two types of unique ID to each user's account:

1. AWS account ID
> It is a 12-digit number which can be used to construct Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)

2. Canonical user ID
>  It is 64-DIGIT HEXADECIMAL ENCODED a 256-bit number.
> It is USED in an Amazon S3 bucket policy FOR CROSS-ACCOUNT ACCESS means that AWS account can access the resources in another AWS account. 
- For example, if you want AWS account access to your bucket, you need to specify the canonical user ID to your bucket's policy.

=======================================
> AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on 5 pillars

1. OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE : 
- The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

2. SECURITY : 
- The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.
- Monitoring and using alerts using CloudTrail and CloudWatch

3. RELIABILITY : 
- The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, DYNAMICALLY ACQUIRE computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.
- NON-OVERLAPPING PRIVATE IP addr is the Reliability pillar 

4. PERFORMANCE EFFICIENCY : 
- The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
- design using elasticity to meet demand is the Performance Efficiency pillar. 

5. COST OPTIMIZATION : 
- The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.
