############## CLOUDTRAIL #############
> It is an AWS service that HELPS TO ENABLE GOVERNANCE, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of AWS account. 
> Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. 
- Events include actions taken in the Console, AWS CLI, SDKs and APIs.

> we can use CloudTrail to view, search, download, archive, analyze, and respond to account activity across your AWS infrastructure

> we can identify who is taking what action. 

> we can easily VIEW EVENTS IN THE CLOUDTRAIL CONSOLE BY GOING TO EVENT HISTORY.
- Event history allows you to view, search, and download the PAST 90 DAYS OF ACTIVITY 

> RECORED INFORMATION INCLUDES 
- identity of the API caller
- time of the API caller
- source IP address of the API caller
- request parameters 
- response element returned by AWS service.


Console/CLI/SDK --> AWS resources --> AWS CloudTrail 
--> save in S3 bucket 
--> do troubleshooting
--> configure CloudWatch for monitor/alarm/react.

#### 2 TYPES OF TRAILS ####

1. A trail that applies to all regions(recommended)
2. A trail that applies to one region

> For both types of trails, we can specify S3 bucket from any region.

#### 1. TRAIL THAT APPLIES TO ALL REGIONS ###
> create a trail that applies to all regions
> CloudTrail records events in each region and delivers the CloudTrail event log files to an S3 bucket that we specify. 

> If a region is added after creating trail then new region will automatically included

### 2. TRAIL THAT APPLIES TO ONE REGION
>> If you create additional single trails, we can have those trails deliver CloudTrail event log files to the same S3 bucket or to separate buckets.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> BY DEFAULT, CLOUDTRAIL EVENT LOG FILES ARE ENCRYPTED USING S3-SSE but we can choose to encrypt with AWS KMS key. 
- store log files in bucket as long as we want. 
- we can define S3 lifecycle rules to archive or delete log files automatically.

## CloudTrail log file integrity validation
> To determine whether a log file was modified, deleted, or unchanged after CloudTrail delivered it, we can use CloudTrail log file integrity validation. 
- This feature is built using industry standard algorithms: SHA-256 for hashing and SHA-256 with RSA for digital signing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What Are Trails?

> A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of CloudTrail events to S3 bucket, CloudWatch Logs, and CloudWatch Events. 
- we can use a trail to filter the CloudTrail events we want delivered, encrypt CloudTrail event log files with an AWS KMS key, and set up SNS notifications for log file delivery. 

=======================================
############# CLOUDWATCH ##############

> It is a service used to monitor your AWS resources and app in real time. 
> we can choose to create dashboard to display the metrics of app.
> CLOUDWATCH SERVICE IS REGION WISE. 

##### FEATURE
> Alarm - use to set alarm that notify when thresholds are hit. 
> CloudWatch Events : use to send system events from AWS resources to AWS Lambda func, SNS topics, stream in Kinesis and other target types. 
> CloudWatch Logs : use to monitor, store and access log files from EC2 instance, cloudTrail.

> Billing Alarm : setup billing alerts if require
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> Using Cloudwatch logs collect, store, view, and search logs from AWS and non-AWS resources.
> CloudWatch alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric. 
- Alarms can go to auto-scaling, EC2 actions(stop, terminate, recover, or reboot) and SNS notifications.
=======================================
########### CLOUDFORMATION ############

> AWS CloudFormation provides users with a simple way to create and manage a collection of AWS resources by provisioning and updating them in a predictable way

> It is a service that allows us to manage, configure and provision AWS infrastructure as a Code (IAAC)

> Resources are defined using CloudFormation template
- CloudFormation interprets the template and make API calls to create resource 

> It support YAML or JSON

> AWS CloudFormation template consists of 9 main objects:
1. Format version
2. Description
3. Metadata
4. Parameters
5. Mappings

6. Conditions 
- Any resources with true condition are created, and invalid conditions are ignored automatically. 

7. Transform
8. Resources: 
- Using this section, you can declare the AWS resource that you want to create and specify in the stack, such as an Amazon S3 bucket or AWS Lambda.

9. Output 

> AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection can be used to detect changes made to AWS resources outside the CloudFormation Templates.
- It only checks property values that are explicitly set by stack templates or by specifying template parameters. 
- It does not determine drift for property values that are set by default. 
- To determine drift for these resources, you can explicitly set property values which can be the same as that of the default value.
=======================================
########## Trusted Advisor ############

> It is an online tool that PROVIDES REAL TIME GUIDANCE to help provision resources following AWS best practices.

cost optimization
Performance
Security
Fault tolerance
Service limit
=======================================
############# AWS Config ##############

> AWS Config is a service that enables you to ASSESS, AUDIT, AND EVALUATE THE CONFIGURATIONS OF AWS RESOURCES.
- it continuously monitors and records AWS resource configurations
- it allows us to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations.
- using it we can review changes in configurations and relationships between AWS resources, dive into detailed resource configuration histories, and determine overall compliance against the configurations specified in internal guidelines.
- This enables you to simplify compliance auditing, security analysis, change management, and operational troubleshooting

=======================================
######### AWS ORGANIZATIONS ###########

> It is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization. 
- you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join organization. 
- You can organize those accounts into groups and attach policy-based controls.
- It helps to CENTRALLY MANAGE BILLING; CONTROL ACCESS, COMPLIANCE, AND SECURITY; AND SHARE RESOURCES across the AWS accounts.
- it enables us to centrally manage policies across multiple accounts, without requiring custom scripts and manual processes.
- It is available to all AWS customers at no additional charge.

> Use Consolidated billing feature in AWS organization to get volume discounts on Amazon EC2

=======================================
########### AWS OpsWorks ##############
> It is a configuration management service that uses Chef, an automation platform that treats server configurations as code. 
- OpsWorks uses Chef to automate how servers are configured, deployed, and managed across your Amazon EC2 instances or on-premise compute environments.


> OPSWORKS WORKS BASED ON STACKS AND LAYERS 
- With OpsWorks Stacks, we can model our application as a stack containing different layers, such as load balancing, database, and application server.
- we can deploy and configure Amazon EC2 instances in each layer or connect other resources such as Amazon RDS databases. 

> OpsWorks is useful when there is a need to have different stacks for the Development and Production environments
