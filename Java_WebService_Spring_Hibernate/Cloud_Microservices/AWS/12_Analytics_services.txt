######### AWS ANALYTICS SERVICES ######

#### AWS KINESIS 
> It is a platform on AWS that sends your STREAMING DATA. 
- It makes it easy to analyze load streaming data and also provides the ability for you to build custom applications based on your business needs.

## AWS Athena
> It is a SERVERLESS PLATFORM which can be USED TO ANALYZE COST & USAGE REPORTS uploaded in Amazon S3 buckets. 
- Using Athena, a customized query can be requested using standard SQL.

## AWS Glue
- It is fully managed ETL service (Extract, Transform and Load) that makes it easy for customer to prepare 	and load their data for analytics

## ElasticSearch 
## AWS EMR (Elastic MapReduce)
=======================================
############ AWS KINESIS ##############

> we can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to collect and PROCESS LARGE STREAMS OF DATA RECORDS IN REAL TIME. 
- it is a collection of services for processing streams of various data.

> Data is processed in “shards” – with each shard able to ingest 1000 records per second.
- There is a default limit of 500 shards, but you can request an increase to unlimited shards.

> A record consists of a partition key, sequence number, and data blob (up to 1 MB).

> Transient data store – default retention of 24 hours, but can be configured for up to 7 days.

> There are 4 types of Kinesis service 
1. Kinesis Video Streams 
- securely process video stream for analytics, ML etc
- support encryption at rest with KMS

2. Kinesis Data Streams
- It can process stream of big data
- we can create data-processing app using this service
- it can stores data for later processing (key diff with Firehose)
- Kinesis Data Streams replicates synchronously across three AZs.

3. Kinesis Data Firehose
- it Captures, transforms, and loads streaming data.
- Kinesis Data Streams can be used as the source(s) to Kinesis Data Firehose.
- it can batch, compress, and encrypt data before loading it.
- NO SHARDS, TOTALLY AUTOMATED.

4. Kinesis Data Analytics
- it is the easiest way to process and analyze real-time, streaming data.
- Can use standard SQL queries to process Kinesis data streams.
- Can ingest data from Kinesis Streams and Kinesis Firehose.


> Kinesis streams can be used to analyze the data and can feed it using AWS EMR to the analytics-based database like RedShift which works on OLAP.

> Kinesis Firehose is used to ship the data to other AWS service, not for the analysis
=======================================
############## AWS EMR ################

> It is a web service that enables businesses, researchers, data analysts, and developers to easily and cost-effectively process vast amounts of data.
- it utilizes a hosted Hadoop framework running on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.
- it also support Apache Spark, HBase, Presto and Flink

> Most commonly used for log analysis, financial analysis, or extract, translate and loading (ETL) activities.

> With EMR, you have ACCESS TO THE UNDERLYING OS
