=======================================
############ AWS DataSync #############
> It is an online data transfer service that simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving data between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage services, as well as between AWS Storage services.

## How AWS DataSync works?

1. To transfer data between on-premises storage and AWS, deploy an agent
- Deploy a DataSync agent and associate it to your AWS account. 
- Deploying an agent is not required to transfer data between AWS Storage services within the same AWS account.

2. Create a task
- Create a task by specifying the location of your data source and destination, and any options you want to use to configure the transfer.

3. Start the transfer
- Start the task and monitor data movement in the console or with Amazon CloudWatch.
