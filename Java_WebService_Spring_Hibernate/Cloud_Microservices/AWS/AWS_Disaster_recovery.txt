> Disaster Recover(DR)
- is the process of designing an architecture that is able to recover from any disaster situation within a stipulated time. 
- The cost of DR planning is inversely proportional to the time required to recover the infrastructure. 

## 2 critical aspects of a DR plan 

1. Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 
- This defines the time within which business processes should be recovered from downtime.

2. Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 
- This defines the acceptable amount of data loss, measured in time

=======================================
##### Disaster Recovery with AWS ######

> DR approach can be broadly categorized in four models:
1. Backup and restore (most economical but time-taking)
2. Pilot light
3. Warm standby
4. Multi-site (expensive but fast)

#### Backup and restore #####
> This approach to DR involves periodically backing up critical data on tape drive and keeping it in a safe and secured place for later use. 
- In the event of disaster, the backed-up data can be restored as needed.

#### Pilot Light
>> the minimal DR version with the most critical components of the environment is always kept running in parallel with the production environment. 

#### Warm Standby
> It extends the pilot light DR model. 
> In the case of the pilot light model, you need to create additional instances or resources to match the size of the primary environment. 
- warm standby keeps a fully functional DR setup with a minimum fleet of instances with the minimum possible size of instances.

> In the event of any disaster, DR setup is scaled up to match the primary site and traffic is failed over to the DR setup

#### Multi-site
> infrastructure of the same size is always in sync and running at multiple locations. 
- These multiple locations can be between a physical data center and AWS or between various AWS regions. 
- In some practices, the secondary site keeps handling partial traffic in parallel to the production environment
