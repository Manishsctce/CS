A. Buckets are created in specific regions.
B. Bucket names exist in a per-region namespace.
C. Buckets are object-based.
D. Each S3 bucket stores up to 5 TB of object data.

Answer : B,D

> While S3 buckets are created in a specific region (A), the names of buckets are global and must exist in a global namespace (so B is untrue). 
Buckets are object-based (so C is true), and while a single object is limited at 5 TB, the buckets are unlimited in total storage capacity (so D is false).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 80. Which of the following consistency models are supported by S3? (Choose two.)

A. Read after write consistency
B. Synchronous consistency
C. Write after read consistency
D. Eventual consistency

Answer : ad

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 82. Which of the following is the best approach to ensuring that objects in your S3 buckets are not accidentally deleted?

A. Restrictive bucket permissions
B. Enabling versioning on buckets
C. Enabling MFA Delete on buckets
D. All of these options are equally useful.

Answer : C

> MFA Delete is the absolute best means of ensuring that objects are not accidentally deleted. 
- MFA—Multi-Factor Authentication—ensures that any object deletion requires multiple forms of authentication.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 83. What HTTP request header is used by MFA Delete requests?

A. x-delete
B. x-amz-mfa
C. x-aws-mfa
D. x-amz-delete

A. Deleting an S3 bucket
B. Changing the versioning state of a bucket
C. Permanently deleting an object version
D. Deleting an object’s metadata

Answer : B, C. 

MFA Delete applies to deleting objects, not buckets. It affects changing the versioning state of a bucket or permanently deleting any object (or a version of that object); this makes B and C correct. 

Deleting an object’s metadata while leaving the object intact does not require MFA Delete.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 85. When using an MFA Delete–enabled bucket to delete an object, from where does the authentication code come?

A. A hardware or virtual MFA device
B. The token section of the AWS console
C. The AWS REST API under delete-codes in a bucket’s metadata

## 88. Which of the following exist and are attached to an object stored in S3? (Choose two.)

A. Metadata
B. Data
C. Authentication ID
D. Version history

Answer : A,B

> Each object in S3 has a name, value (data), version ID, and metadata. 
The version history of an object won’t exist unless versioning is turned on, so it’s not always a valid answer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 89. Which of the following is the AWS mechanism for adding object metadata using the AWS console?

A. Labels
B. Tags
C. Metadata
D. Object name

Answer : B

> All metadata in AWS is currently entered using tags, name-value pairs available through the console.

EC2## 1. You are working for a weather station in Asia with a weather monitoring system that needs to be migrated to AWS. Since the monitoring system requires a low network latency and high network throughput, you decided to launch your EC2 instances to a new cluster placement group. The system was working fine for a couple of weeks, however, when you try to add new instances to the placement group that already has running EC2 instances, you receive an 'insufficient capacity error'.
How will you fix this issue? 
​
A. Verify all running instances are of the same size and type and then try the launch again.

B. Create another Placement Group and launch the new instances in the new group.

C. Stop and restart the instances in the Placement Group and then try the launch again.
​
D. Submit a capacity increase request to AWS as you are initially limited to only 12 instances per Placement Group.

Answer : C

> If you receive a capacity error when launching an instance in a placement group that already has running instances, stop and start all of the instances in the placement group, and try the launch again. Restarting the instances may migrate them to hardware that has capacity for all the requested instances.

ec2 ## 2. A multinational corporate and investment bank is regularly processing steady workloads of accruals, loan interests, and other critical financial calculations every night at 10 PM to 3 AM on their on-premises data center for their corporate clients. Once the process is done, the results are then uploaded to the Oracle General Ledger which means that the processing should not be delayed nor interrupted. The CTO has decided to move their IT infrastructure to AWS to save cost and to improve the scalability of their digital financial services.   

As the Senior Solutions Architect, how can you implement a cost-effective architecture in AWS for their financial system? 

A. Use On-Demand EC2 instances which allows you to pay for the instances that you launch and use by the second.
​
B. Use Dedicated Hosts which provide a physical host that is fully dedicated to running your instances, and bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to reduce costs.
​
C. Use Spot EC2 Instances launched by a persistent Spot request, which can significantly lower your Amazon EC2 costs.
​
D. Use Scheduled Reserved Instances, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule.

ANSWER : D

EXPLANATION :
Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances) enable you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a one-year term. You reserve the capacity in advance, so that you know it is available when you need it. You pay for the time that the instances are scheduled, even if you do not use them.

## 3. A mobile application stores pictures in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and allows application sign-in using an OpenID Connect-compatible identity provider.

Which AWS Security Token Service approach to temporary access should you use for this scenario?
​
A. Cross-Account Access
B. SAML-based Identity Federation
C. Web Identity Federation
D. AWS Identity and Access Management roles

ANSWER : C

Explanation : 
With web identity federation, you don't need to create custom sign-in code or manage your own user identities. Instead, users of your app can sign in using a well-known identity provider (IdP) —such as Login with Amazon, Facebook, Google, or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC)-compatible IdP, receive an authentication token, and then exchange that token for temporary security credentials in AWS that map to an IAM role with permissions to use the resources in your AWS account. Using an IdP helps you keep your AWS account secure because you don't have to embed and distribute long-term security credentials with your application.

## 5. You are working as an IT Consultant for a top investment firm. Your task is to ensure smooth upgrade of their accounting system in AWS to a new version without any system outages. The Technical Manager gave an advice to implement an in-place upgrade strategy while a DevOps Engineer suggested to use Blue/Green Deployment strategy instead.

Which of the following options are not the advantages of using Blue/Green Deployment over in-place upgrade strategy? (Select TWO.)

A. Impaired operation or downtime is minimized because impact is limited to the window of time between green environment issue detection and shift of traffic back to the blue environment.

B. You can use Blue/Green Deployment with CodeCommit and CodeBuild to automatically deploy the new version of your application.

C. It has the ability to simply roll the incoming traffic back to the currently working environment, in case of system failures, any time during the deployment process.

D. Blue/green deployments provide a level of isolation between your blue and green application environments, which reduce the deployment risk. The blue environment represents the current application version serving production traffic while the green one is staged running a different or upgrade version of your application.

E. Blue/green deployment is more cost-effective than in-place upgrade. You don't need to launch a new environment with additional AWS resources.
