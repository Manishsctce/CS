A. Buckets are created in specific regions.
B. Bucket names exist in a per-region namespace.
C. Buckets are object-based.
D. Each S3 bucket stores up to 5 TB of object data.

Answer : B,D

> While S3 buckets are created in a specific region (A), the names of buckets are global and must exist in a global namespace (so B is untrue). 
Buckets are object-based (so C is true), and while a single object is limited at 5 TB, the buckets are unlimited in total storage capacity (so D is false).
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 80. Which of the following consistency models are supported by S3? (Choose two.)

A. Read after write consistency
B. Synchronous consistency
C. Write after read consistency
D. Eventual consistency

Answer : ad

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 82. Which of the following is the best approach to ensuring that objects in your S3 buckets are not accidentally deleted?

A. Restrictive bucket permissions
B. Enabling versioning on buckets
C. Enabling MFA Delete on buckets
D. All of these options are equally useful.

Answer : C

> MFA Delete is the absolute best means of ensuring that objects are not accidentally deleted. 
- MFA—Multi-Factor Authentication—ensures that any object deletion requires multiple forms of authentication.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 83. What HTTP request header is used by MFA Delete requests?

A. x-delete
B. x-amz-mfa
C. x-aws-mfa
D. x-amz-delete

A. Deleting an S3 bucket
B. Changing the versioning state of a bucket
C. Permanently deleting an object version
D. Deleting an object’s metadata

Answer : B, C. 

MFA Delete applies to deleting objects, not buckets. It affects changing the versioning state of a bucket or permanently deleting any object (or a version of that object); this makes B and C correct. 

Deleting an object’s metadata while leaving the object intact does not require MFA Delete.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 85. When using an MFA Delete–enabled bucket to delete an object, from where does the authentication code come?

A. A hardware or virtual MFA device
B. The token section of the AWS console
C. The AWS REST API under delete-codes in a bucket’s metadata

## 88. Which of the following exist and are attached to an object stored in S3? (Choose two.)

A. Metadata
B. Data
C. Authentication ID
D. Version history

Answer : A,B

> Each object in S3 has a name, value (data), version ID, and metadata. 
The version history of an object won’t exist unless versioning is turned on, so it’s not always a valid answer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 89. Which of the following is the AWS mechanism for adding object metadata using the AWS console?

A. Labels
B. Tags
C. Metadata
D. Object name

Answer : B

> All metadata in AWS is currently entered using tags, name-value pairs available through the console.
