############# VPC #############

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Your company is planning on setting up a hybrid connection between their on-premises infrastructure and an AWS VPC via AWS VPN managed connections. As an architect which of the following need to be in place for the connection to be established?. Choose 2 answers from the options given below 

A hardware compatible VPN device
A Virtual private gateway
An AWS Direct connect device
Optical fibre cables

Answer - A and B

When defining a VPN connection between the on-premises network and the VPC, you need to have a customer gateway defined. Since this is accessed over the internet, it needs to have a static internet-routable IP Address.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You are working as an architect in your organization. You have peered VPC A as requester and VPC B as accepter and both VPCs can communicate with each other. Now you want resources in both the VPCs to reach out to the internet but anyone on the internet should not be able to reach resources within&nbsp;both the VPCs. Which of the below will achieve the desired outcome? [WL-VPC-1]

Create a NAT Gateway in VPC A and route VPC B's outbound to VPC A's NAT Gateway
Create an Internet Gateway in VPC A and route VPC B's outbound to VPC A's Internet Gateway
Create NAT Gateways in both VPCs and configure routes for each VPC to use its own NAT Gateway.
Simply create a NAT Instance in VPC A.&nbsp; Nothing else is required

Answer: C

Option A is INCORRECT because you can't share NAT gateways across VPCs.
Option B is INCORRECT because attaching an IGW to a VPC allows instances with public IPs to access the internet, while NATs allow instances with no public IPs to access the internet.
Option C is CORRECT because you can create NAT Gateways on both VPC's and configure routes to the NAT Gateways in the respective route tables.
Option D is INCORRECT because a stand-alone NAT Instance in VPC A doesn't accomplish&nbsp;anything.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Your organization already had a VPC(10.10.0.0/16) setup with one public(10.10.1.0/24) and two private subnets – private subnet 1 (10.10.2.0/24) and private subnet 2 (10.10.3.0/24). The public subnet has the main route table and two private subnets have two different route tables respectively. AWS sysops team reports a problem starting the EC2 instance in private subnet 1 cannot communicate to the RDS MySQL database which is on private subnet 2. What are the possible reasons? (choose 2 options) [WL-VPC-2]

One of the private subnet route table’s local route has been changed to restrict access only within the subnet IP range.
RDS security group inbound rule is incorrectly configured with 10.10.1.0/24 instead of 10.10.2.0/24.
10.10.3.0/24 subnet's NACL is modified to&nbsp;deny&nbsp;inbound on port 3306&nbsp;from subnet 10.10.2.0/24
RDS Security group outbound does not contain a rule for ALL traffic or port 3306 for 10.10.2.0/24 IP range.

Answer: B, C

Option A, for any route table, the local route cannot be edited or deleted

"Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC over IPv4. If your VPC has more than one IPv4 CIDR block, your route tables contain a local route for each IPv4 CIDR block. If you've associated an IPv6 CIDR block with your VPC, your route tables contain a local route for the IPv6 CIDR block. You cannot modify or delete these routes."

For Option B, possible because the security group is configured with public subnet IP range instead of private subnet 1 IP range and EC2 is in private subnet 1. So EC2 will not be able to communicate with RDS in private subnet 2.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## A new VPC with CIDR range 10.10.0.0/16 has been setup with a public and a private subnet. Internet Gateway and a custom route table have been created and a route has been added with the 'Destination' as '0.0.0.0/0' and the 'Target' with Internet Gateway ( igw-id ). A new Linux EC2 instance has been launched on the public subnet with the auto-assign public IP option enabled, but when trying to SSH into the machine, the connection is getting failed. What could be the reason? [WL-VPC-3]

Elastic IP is not assigned.
Both the subnets are associated with the main route table, no subnet is explicitly associated with the custom route table which has internet gateway route
Public IP address is not assigned
None of the above.

Answer: B

Option A, An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address with which you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You are an architect in your organization. Your organization would want to upload files to AWS S3 bucket privately through AWS VPC. In an existing VPC, you created a subnet and VPC endpoint for S3. You also created one route table which routes the traffic from the subnet to a NAT gateway and also the traffic to S3 through the internet via the NAT gateway. But in AWS S3 server logs, you noticed that the request to S3 bucket from an EC2 instance is not coming via the Internet through the NAT Gateway. What could be causing this situation? [WL-VPC-4]

When NAT Gateway and VPC endpoint exist on same route table, NAT Gateway always takes precedence.
EC2 instance is having an elastic IP address associated with it.
The request was redirected through the VPC endpoint
AWS S3 is a managed service, all requests will always go through internet.

Answer: C

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Your organization has an existing VPC with an AWS S3 VPC endpoint created and serving certain S3 buckets. You were asked to create a new S3 bucket and reuse the existing VPC endpoint to route requests to the new S3 bucket. However, after creating a new S3 bucket and sending requests from an EC2 instance via VPC endpoint, you found the requests are failing with the “Access Denied” error. What could be the issue? (select 2 options)

VPC endpoint contains a policy, currently restricted to certain S3 buckets and does not contain a new S3 bucket.
AWS IAM role/user does not have access to the new S3 bucket
AWS default DENY policy restricts access to IAM user/role who already has access to the S3 bucket
You need to add a new S3 bucket hostname as destination and VPC endpoint ID as target in route table in order to route requests to the new S3 bucket.

Answer: A, B

Option A is correct, VPC endpoint has a policy which by default allows all actions on all S3 buckets. We can restrict access to certain S3 buckets and certain actions on this policy. In such cases, for accessing any new buckets or for any new actions, the VPC endpoint policy needs to be modified accordingly.

Option B is correct, AWS IAM role/user which is used to access S3 bucket needs to have access granted via IAM policy before accessing. So if the IAM role/user is not an administrator or not having full S3 access, a newly created S3 bucket must be added to the IAM policy.

## How many tunnels for network traffic are involved when a customer gateway connects to an AWS VPC via an AWS-managed VPN connection?

A. One
B. Two
C. Three
D. It depends on the settings in the AWS VPC.

Answer: B. 

A typical VPN connection uses two different tunnels for redundancy. Both tunnels move between the customer gateway and the virtual private gateway.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Choose the correct order in which traffic flows from an on-premises site to a VPC within AWS when a VPN connection is used.

A. Customer gateway to Amazon VPC to virtual private gateway
B. Virtual private gateway to customer gateway to Amazon VPC
C. Amazon VPC to customer gateway to virtual private gateway
D. Customer gateway to virtual private gateway to Amazon VPC


Answer: D. 
Traffic begins at the on-premises site, which means starting at a customer gateway. Traffic then flows through the Internet and to the virtual private gateway at AWS. Then, from the gateway, traffic can flow into an Amazon VPC.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You are setting up a site-to-site VPN from an on-premises network into an AWS VPC. Which of the following are steps you may need to perform? (Choose two.)

A. Set up a public IP address for the customer gateway.
B. Set up a public IP address for the AWS VPC.
C. Set up a public IP address for the virtual private gateway.
D. Set up a public IP address for the VPN tunnels.

Answer: A, C. 

Traffic across the Internet can only flow between public IP addresses in most cases. 
> For a VPN connection, we need a customer gateway with a public IP address as well as a virtual private gateway with a public IP address, both of which you may be responsible for configuring. 
A VPC does not have an IP address of its own (making option B incorrect), and VPN tunnels do not either (option D).

### A company hosts a popular web application that connects to an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance running in a default VPC private subnet created with default ACL settings. The web servers must be accessible only to customers on an SSL connection and the database must only be accessible to web servers in a public subnet. Which solution would meet these requirements without impacting other applications? (SELECT TWO) [WL112]

A. Create a network ACL on the Web Server's subnets, allow HTTPS port 443 inbound and specify the source as 0.0.0.0/0
B. Create a Web Server security group that allows HTTPS port 443 inbound traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) and apply it to the Web Servers.
C. Create a DB Server security group that allows MySQL port 3306 inbound and specify the source as the Web Server security group.
D. Create a network ACL on the DB subnet, allow MySQL port 3306 inbound for Web Servers and deny all outbound traffic.
E. Create a DB Server security group that allows HTTPS port 443 inbound and specify the source as a Web Server security group.


ANSWER :  B and C

EXPLANATION : 
1) To ensure that traffic can flow into your web server from anywhere on secure traffic, you need to allow inbound security at 443.
2) And then, you need to ensure that traffic can flow from the database server to the web server via the database security group.

Options A and D are invalid answers. 
Network ACLs are stateless. So we need to set rules for both inbound and outbound traffic for Network ACLs.  
Option E is also invalid because, in order to communicate with the MySQL servers, we need to allow traffic to flow through port 3306.
Note: The above correct options are the combination of steps required to secure your web and database servers. In addition, the company may implement additional security measures from their end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
### You have planned to host a web application on AWS. You create an EC2 Instance in a public subnet which needs to connect to an EC2 Instance that will host an Oracle database. Which steps would ensure a secure setup? (SELECT TWO) [WL208]


A. Place the EC2 Instance with the Oracle database in the same public subnet as the Webserver for faster communication. 
B. Place the ec2 instance in a public subnet and the oracle database in a private subnet
C. Create a database Security group which allows incoming traffic only from the Web server's security group. 
D. Ensure that the database security group allows incoming traffic from 0.0.0.0/0

### You currently have your EC2 instances running in multiple availability zones. You have a NAT gateway defined for your private instances and you want to make this highly available. How could this be accomplished? [WL218]

A. Create another NAT Gateway and place it behind an ELB.
B. Create a NAT Gateway in another Availability Zone.
C. Create a NAT Gateway in another region.
D. Use Auto Scaling groups to scale the NAT Gateway. 


ANSWER : B

EXPLANATION: 
If you have resources in multiple Availability Zones and they share one NAT Gateway, in the event that the NAT Gateway’s Availability Zone is down, resources in the other Availability Zones lose internet access. 
- To create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT Gateway in each Availability Zone and configure your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT Gateway in the same Availability Zone.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
### You have an EC2 Instance placed inside a public subnet. It is required to ensure that the EC2 Instance has complete access to the Internet. What would be helpful to accomplish this? [WL230]
                
A. Launch a NAT Gateway and add routes for 0.0.0.0/0
B. Attach a VPC Endpoint and add routes for 0.0.0.0/0
C. Attach an Internet Gateway and add routes for 0.0.0.0/0
D. Deploy NAT Instances in a public subnet and add routes for 0.0.0.0/0


ANSWER : C

EXPLANATION: 
An Internet Gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the Internet. It, therefore, imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

############# CloudFront ##############

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## A website runs on EC2 Instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Auto Scaling Group across multiple Availability Zones and deliver several static files that are stored on a shared Amazon EFS file system. The company needs to avoid serving the files from EC2 Instances every time a user requests these digital assets. What should the company do to improve the user experience of the website?

A. Move the digital assets to Amazon Glacier.
B. Cache static content using CloudFront.
C. Resize the images so that they are smaller.
D. Use reserved EC2 Instances.


ANSWER : B

EXPLANATION : 
- Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files to your users.
- CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. 
- When a user requests content that you're serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay), so that the content is delivered with the best possible performance. 
- If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it immediately. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## An organization hosts a multi-language website on AWS, which is served using CloudFront. Language is specified in the HTTP request as shown below:

http://d11111f8.cloudfront.net/main.html?language=de
http://d11111f8.cloudfront.net/main.html?language=en
http://d11111f8.cloudfront.net/main.html?language=es
How should AWS CloudFront be configured to deliver cached data in the correct language? [WL122]

A. Forward cookies to the origin
B. Based on query string parameters
C. Cache objects at the origin
D. Serve dynamic content

ANSWER : B

EXPLANATION : 
Since language is specified in the query string parameters, CloudFront should be configured for the same.
