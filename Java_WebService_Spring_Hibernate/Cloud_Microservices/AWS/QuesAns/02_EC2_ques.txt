## A company is planning on moving their virtual servers from their on-premises infrastructure to the AWS Cloud. They need to migrate their existing VM's to the cloud. Which of the following could help them in the migration process?

A. AWS VM Import
B. AWS S3
C. AWS SQS
D. AWS EC2

Answer (A)

VM Import/Export enables you to easily import virtual machine images from your existing environment to Amazon EC2 instances and export them back to your on-premises environment. This offering allows you to leverage your existing investments in the virtual machines that you have built to meet your IT security, configuration management, and compliance requirements by bringing those virtual machines into Amazon EC2 as ready-to-use instances. You can also export imported instances back to your on-premises virtualization infrastructure, allowing you to deploy workloads across your IT infrastructure.

## You have been hired as an AWS Architect for a company. There is a requirement to host an application using EC2 Instances. The Infrastructure needs to scale on demand and also be fault tolerant. Which of the following would you include in the design? Choose 2 answers from the options below

AWS Autoscaling
ECS
Elastic Load Balancer
Cloudwatch

Answer - A and C

You can automatically increase/decrease the size of ASG when demand goes up/down. As the ASG adds and removes EC2 instances, you must ensure that the traffic for app is distributed across all of your EC2 instances. 
The ELB service automatically routes incoming web traffic across such a dynamically changing number of EC2 instances.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Your company has setup EC2 Instances in a VPC for their application. The IT Security department has advised that all traffic be monitored to the EC2 Instances.
Which of the following features can be used to capture information for outgoing and incoming IP traffic from network interfaces in a VPC.

Cloudwatch
EC2
SQS
VPC Flow Logs

Answer – D

VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon S3. After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen destination.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Your company has setup EC2 Instances in a VPC for their app. The IT Security department needs to understand what the security mechanisms are available to protect the Instances when it comes to traffic going in and out of the instance. What are the two layers of security provided by AWS in the VPC? Choose 2 answers from the options given below

Security Groups 
NACLs
DHCP options
Route Tables  

Answer - A and B
SG act as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic. When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance.

NACL is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.

## Which of the following are features of AWS ECS? (Choose 3 options) [WL-EC2-1]

A. Task Definition
B. Tasks
C. Container Registery      
D. Cluster
E. Source Image Storage  

Answer - A,B,D

Option C is not part of ECS. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) is a fully managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which of the following statement defines task definition? [WL-EC2-2]

A. JSON template that describes containers which forms your application.
B. Template for a program that runs inside AWS ECS Cluster.
C. AWS managed service that launches ECS clusters.
D. Template that defines actions for each IAM user on the ECS cluster and its containers.

Answer : A
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html

> A task definition is required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. It is a text file in JSON format that describe 1 or more containers, up to 10(max).
- it will be blueprint of app.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Your organization is planning to use AWS ECS for docker applications. However, they would like to apply 3rd party monitoring tools on the ECS instances. They approached you asking for a recommendation. What do you suggest? [WL-EC2-3]

A. AWS ECS is a managed service. Customers cannot install 3rd party softwares. Use CloudWatch for monitoring metrics
B. Customers will have control over AWS ECS instances and can setup monitoring like a normal EC2 instance.
C. Raise a case with AWS to install 3rd party software on ECS. AWS will review the case and install if 3rd party software is in their trusted software entries
D. AWS ECS is a managed service. Customers cannot install 3rd party softwares. Use application level monitoring.

Answer : B
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ECS_instances.html
Options A and D are not correct. AWS ECS uses EC2 instances with ECS-optimized AMI. You will have root access to the instances and you can manage them.	
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which of the following is a correct statement in relation to ECS instances when accessing Amazon ECS service endpoint? [WL-EC2-4]

A. Create an Interface VPC Endpoint for ECS service and attach to VPC subnet’s route table in which ECS instances are running.
B. ECS intances are launched with ECS-optimized AMI which contains an inbuilt mechanism to communicate with ECS service endpoints through AWS network.
C. Create a NAT Gateway and attach it to VPC subnet’s route table in which ECS instances are running.
D. AWS service endpoints are accessible internally across VPCs. You need to enable IAM role access on the service which needs to be accessed

Answer : C
The container agent runs on each infrastructure resource within an Amazon ECS cluster. It sends information about the resource's current running tasks and resource utilization to Amazon ECS, and starts and stops tasks whenever it receives a request from Amazon ECS.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You have launched an ECS cluster with 5 EC2 instances with its task definitions. However, ECS is not getting any status information back from the container agent in each ECS instance. What could be the reason? (choose 3 options) [WL-EC2-5]

A. IAM role used to run ECS instance does not have ecs:Poll action in its policy
B. Key-pair information is missing in ECS cluster
C. ECS  Instance  security  groups’  outbound  rules  are  not  allowing  traffic  to  ECS  service endpoint
D. Interface VPC endpoint is not configured for ECS service
E. You are running ECS on t2.micro instance type which is not supported

Answer: A, C, D

Option A is correct. The Amazon ECS container agent makes calls to the Amazon ECS API on your behalf. Container instances that run the agent require an IAM policy and role for the service to know that the agent belongs to you. Before you can launch container instances and register them into a cluster, you must create an IAM role for those container instances to use when they are launched. This requirement  applies  to  container  instances  launched  with  the  Amazon  ECS-optimized  AMI provided by Amazon, or with any other instances that you intend to run the agent on.

Option B is not correct. Amazon ECS container instance, has no password to use for SSH access; you use a key pair to log in to your instance securely. You specify the name of the key pair when you launch your container instance, then provide the private key when you log in using SSH.

Option C is correct. Security groups act as a firewall to ECS container instances. If outbound rules are not allowing any traffic to ECS service endpoints, container agent will not be able to report the status back to ECS.

Option E is not correct. T2.micro is supported for container instance.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which of the following can be used with Amazon ECS to run Containers without having to manage servers or clusters of Amazon EC2 instances?

A. AWSVPC

## How does AWS allow you to add metadata to your EC2 instances? (Choose two.)

A. Certificates
B. Tags
C. Policies
D. Labels

Answer: A, D

All instances and most services in AWS provide tagging for metadata. 
Certificates are related to SSL and help define the identity of a site or transmission, policies are related to permissions and roles, and labels are not (currently) an AWS construct.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Where are individual EC2 instances provisioned?

A. In a specific region
B. In a specific availability zone
C. In a random availability zone within a specified region
D. It depends upon the region.

Answer: B
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which of the following can be deployed across availability zones?

A. Cluster placement groups
B. Placement groups
C. Spread placement groups
D. Cross-region placement groups

Answer: C. 

Spread placement groups—which are relatively new to AWS—can be placed across multiple availability zones. 
Cluster placement groups cannot, and placement groups generally refers to cluster placement groups. 
Cross-region placement groups is a made-up term.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which of the following services is used at an on-premises site to build a site-to-site VPN connection?

A. Storage gateway
B. Virtual private gateway
C. Customer gateway
D. Virtual private network

Answer: C. 
A customer gateway is the anchor on the customer side of an Amazon VPN connection. A storage gateway is for caching or storing data and connecting to S3. A virtual private gateway is an important part of a VPN connection but exists on the AWS side of the connection. A virtual private network is actually what VPN stands for.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the anchor on the AWS side of a site-to-site VPN connection between an onpremises site and AWS?

A. IPSec tunnel
B. Virtual private gateway
C. Customer gateway
D. VPC
