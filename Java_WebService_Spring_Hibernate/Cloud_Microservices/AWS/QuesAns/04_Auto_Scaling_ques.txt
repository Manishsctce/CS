## A website is hosted on two EC2 instances that sit behind an Elastic Load Balancer. The response time of the website has slowed dramatically, and customers are ordering less due to the wait time. Troubleshooting showed one of the EC2 instances failed and left just one instance running. What is the best course of action to prevent this from happening in the future?

A. Change the instance size to the maximum available to compensate for failure
B. Use CloudWatch to monitor the VPC Flow Logs for the VPC the instances are deployed in
C. Configure the ELB to perform health checks on the EC2 instances and implement auto-scaling
D. Replicate the existing configuration in several regions for failover


Answer - C

EXPLANATION : 

C. Using the elastic load balancer to perform health checks will determine whether or not to remove a non- or underperforming instance and have the auto-scaling group launch a new instance

A. Increasing the instance size doesn’t prevent failure of one or both the instances, therefore the website can still become slow or unavailable
B. Monitoring the VPC flow logs for the VPC will capture VPC traffic, not traffic for the EC2 instance. You would need to create a flow log for a network interface
D. Replicating the same two instance deployment may not prevent failure of instances and could still result in the website becoming slow or unavailable.

## Which of the following items are included in an Auto Scaling Launch Configuration? (Choose two.)

A. The AMI to use for creating new instances
B. The EBS storage volume for the instances to create
C. The polling time for monitoring network latency
D. The IAM role to associate with created instances


Answer: A, D. 

EXPLANATION : 

Launch configurations are concerned primarily with creating new instances while staying abstract from the details of what is on those instances. 
So the AMI and IAM role for an instance is a general configuration, applies to all created instances, and is correct (A and D). 

The polling time for latency isn’t connected to launching new instances (although it might be a trigger configured elsewhere). 
Each instance is associated with a different EBS volume, so selecting an EBS volume for multiple instances doesn’t actually make sense

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which of the following would you use for setting up AMIs from which new instances are created in an Auto Scaling policy?

A. The Auto Scaling policy itself
B. The security group for the Auto Scaling policy
C. The Auto Scaling group used by the Auto Scaling policy
D. The launch configuration used by the Auto Scaling policy


Answer: D. 

EXPLANATION : 
- Launch configurations are where details are specified for creating (launching) new instances (option D). 
- Security groups have to do more with what traffic is allowed into and out of the launched instances. 
- The remaining two options—A and C—don’t make sense in this context.

## An ASG defined in two Availability Zones AZ1, AZ2, in one AWS region, failed to launch instances in AZ1 due to the limited EC2 required instance family capacity. The ASG launched four EC2 instances in AZ2. When the required EC2 instance family capacity becomes available again in AZ1, what would Auto Scaling attempt to do?

a. Launch two additional EC2 instance in AZ1 and keep the four in AZ2
b. Launch two additional EC2 instances in AZ2
c. Try to rebalance the EC2 instances between the two AZS
d. Will not do anything until the next scaling event


Answer: C 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## If configured to do so, Auto Scaling can be used to instruct SNS to send notifications in which of the below events? (Choose 4)

a. When an instance is launched
b. When an instance is terminated
c. When an IAM role is attached to an EC2 instance
d. When a new S3 bucket is created
e. When an EC2 instance fails to launch
f. When an EC2 instance fails to terminate


Answer: a,b,e,f 

EXPLANATION : 
By default AS is not configured to use SNS

## Under normal operations, your company's AWS environment requires three EC2 instances for the web layer. However, the web layer traffic load requires six EC2 instances between noon time and 6PM every day. You are required to configure Auto Scaling policy to achieve scaling out at noon time and scale back in at 6pm every day. Which of the below scaling policy types would you use for this?

a. Use on-demand (event-based) scaling policy
b. Use cyclic (schedule-based) scaling policy
c. Increase your minimum, maximum, and desired capacity to six EC2 instances all the time
d. Manually adjust the desired capacity at noon time (scale out) and at 6pm (scale in)


Answer: b
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## While troubleshooting a problem in your application, you have stopped and restarted an instance multiple times. After the problem was fixed. You then noticed that the associated auto- scaling group has determined the instance as unhealthy, and marked it to be replaced. You do not want Auto scaling to terminate it, what can you do to ensure the instance is back to healthy state and will not get terminated?

a. You can not take it back to a healthy state once it is marked for replacement
b. Reboot the instance, the ASG will then add it back to the healthy state instances
c. Manually add the instance back into the ASG
d. During a very limited time, you can use the AWS CLI command as-set-instance-health to mark the instance as healthy


Answer: d
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## An instance in an auto scaling group has been reported by EC2 status checks to the Auto Scaling process as unhealthy, Auto scaling then marked it for replacement.
Which of the below statements is correct? (Choose 2)

a. Auto Scaling will start shortly after that to terminate the instance
b. Auto Scaling has to launch a replacement first then terminate the unhealthy instance
c. Auto Scaling has to do a rebalancing first then terminate the instance
d. Auto Scaling will terminate the instance first then launch a new, instance


Answer: a, d
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You are newly hired to YCDIT2, Inc. as the AWS SME. You were tasked to review the AWS environment and recommend enhancements. One of the resulting recommendations was to merge the three different single AZ auto scaling groups into one.
How can this be achieved?

a. Delete two of the groups and the third will automatically be configured to stretch and cover the other two AZS
b. Use an AWS CLI command to stitch the three groups into one
c. Define one of the three ASGS to cover the AZS of the other two ASGs and then delete the other two
d. Create a fourth group that covers all three AZs then delete the original three


Answer: c

## You are working as an AWS consultant for a start-up company. They have developed a web application for their employees to share files with external vendors securely. They created an AutoScaling group for the web servers which requires two m4.large EC2 instances running at all times, scaling up to a maximum of twelve instances. Post-deployment of the application, a huge rise in cost was observed. Due to a limited budget, the CTO has requested your advice to optimize the usage of instances in the Auto Scaling groups. What would you suggest to reduce costs without any adverse impact on the performance? [WL107]

A. Create an Auto Scaling group with t2. micro On-Demand instances.
B. Create an Auto Scaling group with a mix of On-Demand & Spot Instance. Select the On-Demand base as zero. Above On-Demand base, select 100% of On-Demand instance & 0% of Spot Instance.
C. Create an Auto Scaling group with all Spot Instance.
D. Create an Auto Scaling group with a mix of On-Demand & Spot Instance. Select the On-Demand base as 2. Above On-Demand base, select 20% of On-Demand instance & 80% of Spot Instance.


ANSWER : D

EXPLANATION : 
Auto Scaling group supports a mix of On-Demand & Spot instance which help to design a cost-optimized solution without any impact on the performance. You can choose the percentage of On-Demand & Spot instance based on the application requirements. 
With Option D, Auto Scaling group will have 2 instances initially as the On-Demand instances while remaining instances will be launched in a ratio of 20 % On-Demand instance & 80% Spot Instance.

Option A is incorrect. With t2. micro, there would be a reduction in cost, but it will impact the performance of the application.
Option B is incorrect as there would not be any cost reduction with all On-Demand instances.
Option C is incorrect. Although this will reduce cost, all spot instance in an auto-scaling group may cause inconsistencies in the application & lead to poor performance.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## While reviewing the Auto Scaling events for your application, you notice that your application is scaling up and down multiple times in the same hour. What changes would you suggest in order to optimize costs while preserving elasticity? (SELECT TWO) [WL111]

A. Modify the Auto Scaling group termination policy to terminate the older instance first. 
B. Modify the Auto Scaling group termination policy to terminate the newest instance first.
C. Modify the Auto Scaling group cool down timers.
D. Modify the Auto Scaling group to use Scheduled Scaling actions.
E. Modify the CloudWatch alarm period that triggers your Auto Scaling scale down policy

### You have a business-critical two-tier web application, currently deployed in 2 Availability Zones in a single region, using Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling. The app depends on synchronous replication at the database layer. The application needs to remain fully available even if one application AZ goes offline or Auto Scaling cannot launch new instances in the remaining AZ. How could the current architecture be enhanced to ensure this? [WL344]

A. Deploy in 2 regions using Weighted Round Robin with Auto Scaling set at minimum 50% peak load per region.
B. Deploy in 3 AZ with Auto Scaling, set to handle minimum 33 percent peak load per zone.
C. Deploy in 3 AZ with Auto Scaling, set to handle minimum 50 percent peak load per zone.
D. Deploy in 2 regions using Weighted Round Robin with Auto Scaling, set at minimum 100% peak load per region. 


EXPLANATION: AS
Correct Answer – C

> Since the requirement states that the application should never go down even if an AZ is not available, we need to maintain 100% availability. 

Options A and D are incorrect because REGION DEPLOYMENT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR ELB. ELBs can manage traffic within a region, not between regions. 
Option B is incorrect because even if one AZ goes down, we would be operating at only 66% and not the required 100%. 

For more information on Auto Scaling, please visit the URL below:
https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/

NOTE:
"The application needs to remain fully available even if one application AZ goes offline and if Auto Scaling cannot launch new instances in the remaining AZ". 
Here you need to maintain 100% availability. 

In option B, when you create 3 AZs with minimum 33% load on each, If any failure occurs in one AZ then 33% + 33% = 66% . 
Here you can handle only 66% and the remaining 34% of load, not handling. 

But when you select option C, when you create 3 AZs with minimum 50% load on each, If any failure occurs in one AZ then 50% + 50% =100% . 
Here you can handle full load i.e 100%.
