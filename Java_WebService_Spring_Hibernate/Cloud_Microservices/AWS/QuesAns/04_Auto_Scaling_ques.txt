## A website is hosted on two EC2 instances that sit behind an Elastic Load Balancer. The response time of the website has slowed dramatically, and customers are ordering less due to the wait time. Troubleshooting showed one of the EC2 instances failed and left just one instance running. What is the best course of action to prevent this from happening in the future?

Change the instance size to the maximum available to compensate for failure
Use CloudWatch to monitor the VPC Flow Logs for the VPC the instances are deployed in
Configure the ELB to perform health checks on the EC2 instances and implement auto-scaling
Replicate the existing configuration in several regions for failover

Answer - C

C. Using the elastic load balancer to perform health checks will determine whether or not to remove a non- or underperforming instance and have the auto-scaling group launch a new instance

A. Increasing the instance size doesn’t prevent failure of one or both the instances, therefore the website can still become slow or unavailable
B. Monitoring the VPC flow logs for the VPC will capture VPC traffic, not traffic for the EC2 instance. You would need to create a flow log for a network interface
D. Replicating the same two instance deployment may not prevent failure of instances and could still result in the website becoming slow or unavailable.

## Which of the following items are included in an Auto Scaling Launch Configuration? (Choose two.)

A. The AMI to use for creating new instances
B. The EBS storage volume for the instances to create
C. The polling time for monitoring network latency
D. The IAM role to associate with created instances

Answer: A, D. 
Launch configurations are concerned primarily with creating new instances while staying abstract from the details of what is on those instances. So the AMI and IAM role for an instance is a general configuration, applies to all created instances, and is correct (A and D). 
The polling time for latency isn’t connected to launching new instances (although it might be a trigger configured elsewhere). Each instance is associated with a different EBS volume, so selecting an EBS volume for multiple instances doesn’t actually make sense

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which of the following would you use for setting up AMIs from which new instances are created in an Auto Scaling policy?

A. The Auto Scaling policy itself
B. The security group for the Auto Scaling policy
C. The Auto Scaling group used by the Auto Scaling policy
D. The launch configuration used by the Auto Scaling policy

Answer: D. 
Launch configurations are where details are specified for creating (launching) new instances (option D). 
Security groups have to do more with what traffic is allowed into and out of the launched instances. 
The remaining two options—A and C—don’t make sense in this context.

## An ASG defined in two Availability Zones AZ1, AZ2, in one AWS region, failed to launch instances in AZ1 due to the limited EC2 required instance family capacity. The ASG launched four EC2
instances in AZ2. When the required EC2 instance family capacity becomes available again in AZ1, what would Auto Scaling attempt to do?

a. Launch two additional EC2 instance in AZ1 and keep the four in AZ2

b. Launch two additional EC2 instances in AZ2
c. Try to rebalance the EC2 instances between the two AZS
d. Will not do anything until the next scaling event

Answer: C

## If configured to do so, Auto Scaling can be used to instruct SNS to send notifications in which of the below events? (Choose 4)

a. When an instance is launched
b. When an instance is terminated
c. When an IAM role is attached to an EC2 instance
d. When a new S3 bucket is created
e. When an EC2 instance fails to launch
f. When an EC2 instance fails to terminate

Answer: a,b,e,f 

By default AS is not configured to use SNS

## Under normal operations, your company's AWS environment requires three EC2 instances for the web layer. However, the web layer traffic load requires six EC2 instances between noon time and 6PM every day. You are required to configure Auto Scaling policy to achieve scaling out at noon time and scale back in at 6pm every day. Which of the below scaling policy types would you use for this?

a. Use on-demand (event-based) scaling policy
b. Use cyclic (schedule-based) scaling policy

c. Increase your minimum, maximum, and desired capacity to six EC2 instances all the time

d. Manually adjust the desired capacity at noon time (scale out) and at 6pm (scale in)

Answer: b

## While troubleshooting a problem in your application, you have stopped and restarted an instance multiple times. After the problem was fixed. You then noticed that the associated auto- scaling group has determined the instance as unhealthy, and marked it to be replaced. You do not want Auto scaling to terminate it, what can you do to ensure the instance is back to healthy state and will not get terminated?

a. You can not take it back to a healthy state once it is marked for replacement

b. Reboot the instance, the ASG will then add it back to the healthy state instances

c. Manually add the instance back into the ASG

d. During a very limited time, you can use the AWS CLI command as-set-instance-health to mark the instance as healthy

Answer: d
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## An instance in an auto scaling group has been reported by EC2 status checks to the Auto Scaling process as unhealthy, Auto scaling then marked it for replacement.
Which of the below statements is correct? (Choose 2)

a. Auto Scaling will start shortly after that to terminate the instance

b. Auto Scaling has to launch a replacement first then terminate the unhealthy instance

c. Auto Scaling has to do a rebalancing first then terminate the instance

d. Auto Scaling will terminate the instance first then launch a new, instance

Answer: a, d

## You are newly hired to YCDIT2, Inc. as the AWS SME. You were tasked to review the AWS environment and recommend enhancements. One of the resulting recommendations was to merge the three different single AZ auto scaling groups into one.
How can this be achieved?

a. Delete two of the groups and the third will automatically be configured to stretch and cover the other two AZS

b. Use an AWS CLI command to stitch the three groups into one

c. Define one of the three ASGS to cover the AZS of the other two ASGs and then delete the other two

d. Create a fourth group that covers all three AZs then delete the original three
