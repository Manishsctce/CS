## What two features are supported with EBS volume Snapshot feature?

A. EBS replication across regions
B. EBS multi-zone replication
C. EBS single region only
D. full snapshot data only
E. unencrypted snapshot only


Answer (A,B)

Explantion - > EBS volume are AZ specific 
- but snapshot are region specific

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is an EBS Snapshot?

A. backup of an EBS root volume and instance data
B. backup of an EC2 instance
C. backup of configuration settings
D. backup of instance store

Answer (A)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You terminate an EC2 instance and find that the EBS root volume that was attached to the instance was also deleted. How can you correct this?

A. You can’t. A root volume is always deleted when the EC2 instance attached to that volume is deleted.
B. Take a snapshot of the EBS volume while the EC2 instance is running. Then, when the EC2 instance is terminated, you can restore the EBS volume from the snapshot.

C. Remove termination protection from the EC2 instance.
D. Use the AWS CLS to change the DeleteOnTermination attribute for the EBS volume to “false.”


Answer: D. 

By default, EBS root volumes are terminated when the associated instance is terminated. However, this is only the default value; therefore A is not correct. Option B is not directly addressing the question; the EBS volume would still be deleted even if you take a snapshot. 
Option C is not relevant, but 
option D : use AWS CLI (or the console) to set the root volume to persist after instance termination.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## In what manner are EBS snapshots backed up to S3?

A. Via full backup according to the backup policy set on the volume
B. Incrementally
C. Synchronously
D. EBS volumes are not stored on S3.


Answer: B
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Can you attach an EBS volume to more than one EC2 instance at the same time?

A. Yes, as long as the volume is not the root volume.
B. No, EBS volumes cannot be attached to more than one instance at the same time.
C. Yes, as long as the volume is one of the SSD classes and not magnetic storage.
D. Yes, as long as at least one of the instances uses the volume as its root volume.


Answer: B

## There is a requirement to host a database application having resource-intensive reads and writes (lots of reads and writes). Which of the below options would be the most suitable to meet this requirement? [WL145]

A. EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD
B. EBS SSD
C. EBS Throughput Optimized HDD
D. EBS Cold Storage


ANSWER : C
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## An application with a 150 GB relational database runs on an EC2 Instance. While the application is used infrequently with small peaks in the morning and evening, which storage type would be the most cost-effective option for the above requirement? [WL106]

A. Amazon EBS provisioned IOPS SSD
B. Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD
C. Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD
D. Amazon EFS


ANSWER : C

EXPLANATION : 
Since the database is used infrequently, not throughout the day, and the question requires the MOST cost-effective storage type, the preferred choice would be EBS General Purpose SSD over EBS provisioned IOPS SSD.

The minimum volume of Throughput Optimized HDD is 500 GB. As per our scenario, we need 150 GB only. 
Hence, option C: Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD, would be the best choice for a cost-effective storage solution. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## An application with a 150 GB relational database runs on an EC2 Instance. This is a critical business application requiring more than 16,000 IOPS of throughput per volume. Which storage type would be preferred? [WL309]

A. Amazon EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD
B. Amazon EBS Throughput Optimized HDD
C. Amazon EBS General Purpose SSD
D. Amazon EFS


EXPLANATION:
Answer – A

 As per AWS documentation Provisioned IOPS (SSD) are used for applications that require high Inputs/Outputs Operations per sec and is mainly used in large databases such as Mongo, Cassandra, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle where as Throughput optimized HDD although it is cheaper compared to PIOPS is used for dataware houses where it is designed to work with throughput intensive workloads such as big data, log processing etc. 
So Option A is the right choice for this case. 
AWS Documentation mentions the following:

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency. 
Max IOPS**/Volume for 

EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD - 64,000
EBS General Purpose SSD - 16,000 
Throughput Optimized HDD - 500
Cold HDD - 250

## The security policy of an organization requires an application to encrypt data before writing to the disk. Which solution should the organization use to meet this requirement? [WL118]

A. AWS KMS API
B. AWS Certificate Manager
C. API Gateway with STS
D. IAM Access Key

ANSWER : A

EXPLANATION : 
Option B is incorrect. The AWS Certificate Manager can be used to generate SSL certificates to encrypt traffic in transit, but not at rest.

Option C is incorrect. It is used for issuing tokens while using the API gateway for traffic in transit.

Option D is used for providing secure access to EC2 Instances.

AWS Documentation mentions the following on AWS KMS:

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. AWS KMS is integrated with other AWS services including Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Redshift, Amazon Elastic Transcoder, Amazon WorkMail, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), and others to make it simple to encrypt your data with encryption keys that you manage.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## An application currently stores all its data on Amazon EBS Volumes. All EBS volumes must be backed up durably across multiple Availability Zones. 
What is the MOST resilient and cost-effective way to back up the volumes? [WL119]

A. Take regular EBS snapshots.
B. Enable EBS volume encryption.
C. Create a script to copy data to an EC2 Instance store.
D. Mirror data across 2 EBS volumes. 

ANSWER : A

EXPLANATION : 
Option B is incorrect because it does not help the durability of EBS Volumes.

Option C is incorrect since EC2 Instance stores are not durable.

Option D is incorrect since mirroring data across EBS volumes is inefficient in comparison with the existing option for EBS snapshots.

AWS Documentation mentions the following on AWS EBS Snapshots:

You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3 by taking point-in-time snapshots. Snapshots are incremental backups, which means that only the blocks on the device that have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. This minimizes the time required to create the snapshot and saves on storage costs by not duplicating data. When you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that snapshot is removed. Each snapshot contains all of the information required to restore your data (from the moment when the snapshot was taken) to a new EBS volume.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## There is a requirement to host a database on an EC2 Instance. It is also required that the EBS volume should support 18,000 IOPS. 
Which Amazon EBS volume type would meet the performance requirements of this database? [WL129]

A. EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD
B. EBS Throughput Optimized HDD
C. EBS General Purpose SSD
D. EBS Cold HDD

ANSWER : A

EXPLANATION : 
For high performance and high IOPS requirements, as in this case, the ideal choice would be to choose EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You work for a company that has a set of EC2 Instances. There is an internal requirement to create another instance in another availability zone. One of the EBS volumes from the current instance needs to be moved from one of the older instances to the new instance. How can you achieve this? [WL602]

A. Detach the volume and attach to an EC2 instance in another AZ.
B. Create a new volume in the other AZ and specify the current volume as the source.
C. Create a snapshot of the volume and then create a volume from the snapshot in the other AZ
D. Create a new volume in the AZ and do a disk copy of contents from one volume to another. 


EXPLANATION: 
Answer – C

> In order for a volume to be available in another availability zone, you need to first create a snapshot from the volume. Then in the snapshot from creating a volume from the snapshot , you can then specify the new availability zone accordingly. 

Option A is invalid, because the Instance and Volume have to be in the same AZ in order for it to be attached to the instance

Option B is invalid , because there is no way to specify a volume as a source

Option D is invalid , because the Diskcopy would just be a tedious process.

ANSWER : 

EXPLANATION : 


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You are building a content serving web application with 20 EC2 instances load balanced. For all the instances, content storage remains the same. You have chosen AWS EFS to act as common storage repository. Your application need to have as low latency as possible when serving content to the web users. Which of the following option would you choose and why? [WL864]

A. Performance mode = General Purpose, AWS can handle performance with general purpose mode till 10s of EC2 instances.
B. Performance mode = General Purpose, provides low-latency access to EFS.
C. Performande mode = Max I/O, provides better performance when sharing EFS across more than 10 EC2 instances.
D. Performance mode = Max I/O, provides low-latency access to EFS. 


EXPLANATION: EFS
Answer: B

 Although Max I/O is recommended to be used when tens, hundreds or thousands of EC2 instances sharing same EFS, it can slightly increase the latency. In this case, the question states the latency need to be as low as possible. 

Performance Modes
To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes. You select a file system's performance mode when you create it. 
The two performance modes have no additional costs, so your Amazon EFS file system is billed and metered the same, regardless of your performance mode. For information about file system limits, see Limits for Amazon EFS File Systems. 
Note

An Amazon EFS file system's performance mode can't be changed after the file system has been created. 
General Purpose Performance Mode
We recommend the General Purpose performance mode for the majority of your Amazon EFS file systems. General Purpose is ideal for latency-sensitive use cases, like web serving environments, content management systems, home directories, and general file serving. If you don't choose a performance mode when you create your file system, Amazon EFS selects the General Purpose mode for you by default. 
Max I/O Performance Mode
File systems in the Max I/O mode can scale to higher levels of aggregate throughput and operations per second with a tradeoff of slightly higher latencies for file operations. Highly parallelized applications and workloads, such as big data analysis, media processing, and genomics analysis, can benefit from this mode.  

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#performancemodes
 

 From above explanation, only option B is a correct statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You are building a content serving web application on 5 EC2 instances load balanced. Total content size stored may not exceed 25 GB. You have chosen EFS for content storage. The content is accessed frequently by large number of users. Which throughput mode would you choose inorder to make sure that application on EC2 instances to EFS data transfer will not have performance bottleneck? [WL865]

A. Throughput mode = Bursting, provides a consistent high throughput for smaller data sizes.
B. Throughput mode = Bursting, automatically bursts throughput based on the requests irrespective of EFS data size
C. Throughput mode = Provisioned, you can configure specific throughput irrespective of EFS data size.
D. Throughput mode = Provisioned, AWS provisions high throughput for smaller data sizes and vice versa. 


EXPLANATION: EFS
Answer: C

> With Bursting Throughput mode, throughput on Amazon EFS scales as a file system grows. 

In this case, data size is 25 GB can burst through 100 MiB/s only for 18 mins/day. 
- Rest of the day, it uses baseline aggregate throughput and gives 1.25 MiB/s throughput. The baseline rate is 50

MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage). 
 

Specifying Throughput with Provisioned Mode
"Provisioned Throughput mode is available for applications with high throughput to storage (MiB/s per TiB) ratios, or with requirements greater than those allowed by the Bursting Throughput mode. 
- For example, say you're using Amazon EFS for development tools, web serving, or content management applications where the amount of data in your file system is low relative to throughput demands. Your file system can now get the high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system".  

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performance.html#throughput-modes
 
For this case, since the data is low compared to the throughput demand, provisioned mode is the right choice for throughput mode.
