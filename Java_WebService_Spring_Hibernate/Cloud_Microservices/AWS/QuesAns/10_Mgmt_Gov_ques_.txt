## Your company currently has a set of EC2 Instances hosted in AWS. The states of these instances need to be monitored and each state change needs to be recorded. Which step could be helpful to fulfill this requirement? (SELECT TWO) [WL204]

A. Use CloudWatch logs to store the state change of the instances. 
B. Create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance
C. Use SQS to trigger a record to be added to a DynamoDB table.  
D. Use AWS Lambda to store a change record in a DynamoDB table. 



ANSWER : B, C

EXPLANATION: 
Create Alarms That Stop, Terminate, Reboot, or Recover an Instance 

Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot or recover your instances. 
- You can use the stop or terminate actions to save money when you no longer need an instance. 
- You can use the reboot and recover actions to automatically reboot those instances or recover them onto new hardware if a system impairment occurs.

The AWSServiceRoleForCloudWatchEvents service-linked role enables AWS to perform alarm actions on your behalf. 
- The first time you create an alarm in the AWS Management Console, the IAM CLI, or the IAM API, CloudWatch creates the service-linked role for you.

> There are a number of scenarios in which you might want to automatically stop or terminate your instance. 
- For example, you might have instances dedicated to batch payroll processing jobs or scientific computing tasks that run for a period of time and then complete their work. Rather than letting those instances sit idle (and accrue charges), you can stop or terminate them, which could help you to save money. 
- The main difference between using the stop and the terminate alarm actions is that you can easily restart a stopped instance if you need to run it again later, and you can keep the same instance ID and root volume. However, you cannot restart a terminated instance instead, you must launch a new instance.

You can add the stop, terminate, reboot or recover actions to any alarm that is set on an Amazon EC2 per-instance metric, including basic and detailed monitoring metrics provided by Amazon CloudWatch (in the AWS/EC2 namespace), as well as any custom metrics that include the InstanceId dimension, as long as its value refers to a valid running Amazon EC2 instance.

For more information on Amazon EC2, please visit the following URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-ug.pdf

Option A is correct. Using Cloudwatch logs collect, store, view, and search logs from AWS and non-AWS resources.
Option B is correct. CloudWatch alarms are used to trigger notifications for any metric. Alarms can go to auto-scaling, EC2 actions(stop, terminate, recover, or reboot) and SNS notifications.
Option C is incorrect as SQS cannot be used for monitoring.
Option D is incorrect as AWS Lambda cannot be used for monitoring.

### 9: An application is hosted in an AWS Fargate cluster that runs a batch job whenever an object is loaded on an Amazon S3 bucket. The minimum number of ECS Tasks is initially set to 1 to save on costs, and it will only increase the task count based on the new objects uploaded on the S3 bucket. Once processing is done, the bucket becomes empty and the ECS Task count should be back to 1.
Which is the most suitable option to implement with the LEAST amount of effort? [UD109]

A. Set up an alarm in CloudWatch to monitor CloudTrail since this S3 object-level operations are recorded on CloudTrail. Set two alarm actions to update ECS task count to scale-out/scale-in depending on the S3 event.

B. Set up a CloudWatch Event rule to detect S3 object PUT operations and set the target to a Lambda function that will run Amazon ECS API command to increase the number of tasks on ECS. Create another rule to detect S3 DELETE operations and run the Lambda function to reduce the number of ECS tasks.


C. Set up an alarm in CloudWatch to monitor CloudTrail since the S3 object-level operations are recorded on CloudTrail. Create two Lambda functions for increasing/decreasing the ECS task count. Set these as respective targets for the CloudWatch Alarm depending on the S3 event.

D. Set up a CloudWatch Event rule to detect S3 object PUT operations and set the target to the ECS cluster with the increased number of tasks. Create another rule to detect S3 DELETE operations and set the target to the ECS Cluster with 1 as the Task count.


EXPLANATION: 
ANSWER : D

> You can use CloudWatch Events to run Amazon ECS tasks when certain AWS events occur. 
- You can set up a CloudWatch Events rule that runs an Amazon ECS task whenever a file is uploaded to a certain Amazon S3 bucket using the Amazon S3 PUT operation. 
- You can also declare a reduced number of ECS tasks whenever a file is deleted on the S3 bucket using the DELETE operation.

> First, you must create a CloudWatch Events rule for the S3 service that will watch for object-level operations – PUT and DELETE objects.
- For object-level operations, it is required to create a CloudTrail trail first. 
- On the Targets section, select the “ECS task” and input the needed values such as the cluster name, task definition and the task count.
- You need two rules – one for the scale-up and another for the scale-down of the ECS task count.

########### CloudFormation ############

## A consulting firm repeatedly builds large architectures for their customers using AWS resources from several AWS services including IAM, Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, DynamoDB and Amazon VPC. The consultants have architecture diagrams for each of their architectures, and are frustrated that they cannot use them to automatically create their resources. Which service should provide immediate benefits to the organization?

A. AWS Beanstalk
B. AWS CloudFormation
C. AWS CodeBuild
D. AWS CodeDeploy


ANSWER : B

EXPLANATION : 
AWS CloudFormation is a service that helps you model and set up your Amazon Web Service resources so that you can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on your applications that run in AWS. You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want (like Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon RDS DB instances), and AWS CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## You are working for a start-up company that develops mobile gaming applications using AWS resources. For creating AWS resources, the project team is using CloudFormation Templates. The Project Team is concerned about the changes made in EC2 instance properties by the Operations Team, apart from parameters specified in CloudFormation Templates. To observe changes in AWS EC2 instance, you advise using CloudFormation Drift Detection. After Drift detection, when you check drift status for all AWS EC2 instance, drift for certain property values having default values for resource properties is not displayed. What would you do to include these resources properties to be captured in CloudFormation Drift Detection?

A. Run CloudFormation Drift Detection on individual stack resources instead of entire CloudFormation stack. 
B. Explicitly set the property value, which can be the same as the default value. 
C. Manually check these resources as this is not supported in CloudFormation Drift Detection. 
D. Assign Read permission to CloudFormation Drift Detection to determine drift.

############ AWS OpsWorks #############
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Your company requires a Stack-based model for its resources in AWS. There is a need to have different stacks for the Development and Production environments. Which of the following can be used for this? [WL336]

A. Use EC2 tags to define different stack layers for your resources.
B. Define the metadata for the different layers in DynamoDB.
C. Use AWS OpsWorks to define the different layers for your application.
D. Use AWS Config to define the different layers for your application. 


EXPLANATION:
Correct Answer - C

The requirement can be fulfilled via the OpsWorks service. 

> AWS OpsWorks Stacks lets you manage applications and servers on AWS and on-premises. 
- With OpsWorks Stacks, you can model your application as a stack containing different layers, such as load balancing, database, and application server.
- You can deploy and configure Amazon EC2 instances in each layer or connect other resources such as Amazon RDS databases. 

For more information on OpsWorks stacks, please visit the following URL:
https://aws.amazon.com/opsworks/stacks/

A stack is basically a collection of instances that are managed together for serving a common task. 
Consider a sample stack whose purpose is to serve web applications. It will be comprised of the following instances. 
A set of application server instances, each of which handles a portion of the incoming traffic. 
A load balancer instance, which takes incoming traffic and distributes it across the application servers. 
A database instance, which serves as a back-end data store for the application servers. 
A common practice is to have multiple stacks that represent different environments. A typical set of stacks consists of:

A development stack to be used by developers to add features, fix bugs, and perform other development and maintenance tasks. 
A staging stack to verify updates or fixes before exposing them publicly. 
A production stack, which is the public-facing version that handles incoming requests from users.
