## A company has a set of Hyper-V machines and VMware virtual machines. They are now planning to migrate these resources to the AWS Cloud. What should they use to move these resources to the AWS Cloud? [WL239]

A. DB Migration utility
B. AWS Server Migration Service
C. Use AWS Migration Tools.
D. Use AWS Config Tools. 


ANSWER : B

EXPLANATION: SMS
> AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) is an agentless service which makes it easier and faster for you to migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS. 
- AWS SMS allows you to automate, schedule, and track incremental replications of live server volumes, making it easier for you to coordinate large-scale server migrations.

#### AWS Database Migration Service ###
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##33:UD5: A leading media company has recently adopted a hybrid cloud architecture which requires them to migrate their application servers and databases in AWS. One of their applications requires a heterogeneous database migration in which you need to transform your on-premises Oracle database to PostgreSQL in AWS. This entails a schema and code transformation before the proper data migration starts.   
Which of the following options is the most suitable approach to migrate the database in AWS? 

A. Use Amazon Neptune to convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database in RDS. Use the AWS Batch to effectively migrate the data from the source database to the target database in a batch process. 

B. First, use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and application code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database.

C. Heterogeneous database migration is not supported in AWS. You have to transform your database first to PostgreSQL and then migrate it to RDS. 

D. Configure a Launch Template that automatically converts the source schema and code to match that of the target database. Then, use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database. 


EXPLANATION : RDS
ANSWER : B

> AWS Database Migration Service helps you migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. 
- The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. 
- The AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.

> AWS Database Migration Service can migrate your data to and from most of the widely used commercial and open source databases. 
- It supports homogeneous migrations such as Oracle to Oracle, as well as heterogeneous migrations between different database platforms, such as Oracle to Amazon Aurora.
-  Migrations can be from on-premises databases to Amazon RDS or Amazon EC2, databases running on EC2 to RDS, or vice versa, as well as from one RDS database to another RDS database. It can also move data between SQL, NoSQL, and text based targets.

In heterogeneous database migrations the source and target databases engines are different, like in the case of Oracle to Amazon Aurora, Oracle to PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server to MySQL migrations. In this case, the schema structure, data types, and database code of source and target databases can be quite different, requiring a schema and code transformation before the data migration starts. That makes heterogeneous migrations a two step process. First use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database, and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database. All the required data type conversions will automatically be done by the AWS Database Migration Service during the migration. The source database can be located in your own premises outside of AWS, running on an Amazon EC2 instance, or it can be an Amazon RDS database. The target can be a database in Amazon EC2 or Amazon RDS.

The option that says: Configure a Launch Template that automatically converts the source schema and code to match that of the target database. Then, use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database is incorrect because Launch templates are primarily used in EC2 to enable you to store launch parameters so that you do not have to specify them every time you launch an instance.

The option that says: Use Amazon Neptune to convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database in RDS. Use the AWS Batch to effectively migrate the data from the source database to the target database in a batch process is incorrect because Amazon Neptune is a fully-managed graph database service and not a suitable service to use to convert the source schema. AWS Batch is not a database migration service and hence, it is not suitable to be used in this scenario. You should use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool and AWS Database Migration Service instead.

The option that says: Heterogeneous database migration is not supported in AWS. You have to transform your database first to PostgreSQL and then migrate it to RDS is incorrect because heterogeneous database migration is supported in AWS using the Database Migration Service.
