## A customer wants to create EBS Volumes in AWS. The data on the volume is required to be encrypted at rest. How could this be achieved? [WL201]

A. Create an SSL Certificate and attach it to the EBS Volume
B. Use KMS to generate encryption keys which can be used to encrypt the volume
C. Use CloudFront in front of the EBS Volume to encrypt all requests
D. Use EBS Snapshots to encrypt the requests. 

ANSWER : b

EXPLANATION: 

When you create a volume, you have an option to encrypt the volume using keys generated by the Key Management Service.

Option A is incorrect since SSL helps to encrypt data in transit.
Option C is incorrect because it also does not help in encrypting the data at rest.
Option D is incorrect because the snapshot of an unencrypted volume is also unencrypted.

## A company is planning on testing a large set of IoT enabled devices. These devices will be streaming data every second. A proper service needs to be chosen in AWS which could be used to collect and analyze these streams in real-time. Which AWS service would be the most appropriate for this purpose? [WL203]

A. Use AWS EMR to store and process the streams
B. Use AWS Kinesis to process and analyze the data
C. Use AWS SQS to store the data

## You have a set of on-premises virtual machines used to serve a web-based application. You need to ensure that a virtual machine if unhealthy is taken out of the rotation. Which of the following options would be used for health checking and DNS failover features for a web application running behind  ELB, to increase redundancy and availability. [WL223]

A. Use Route 53 health checks to monitor the endpoints.
B. Move the solution to AWS and use a Classic Load Balancer.
C. Move the solution to AWS and use an Application Load Balancer.
D. Move the solution to AWS and use a Network Load Balancer. 


ANSWER : A

EXPLANATION: 
Route 53 health checks can be used for any endpoint that can be accessed via the Internet. Hence, this would be an ideal option for monitoring endpoints.

AWS Documentation mentions the following:

You can configure a health check that monitors an endpoint that you specify either by IP address or by the domain name. At regular intervals that you specify, Route 53 submits automated requests over the internet to your application, server or other resources to verify that it's reachable, available and functional. 

 

For more information on Route 53 Health checks, please refer to the URL below.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-failover-simple-configs.html

Note:

As per AWS, once enabled, Route 53 automatically configures and manages health checks for individual ELB nodes. Route 53 also takes advantage of the EC2 instance health checking that ELB performs. By combining the results of health checks of your EC2 instances and your ELBs, Route 53 DNS Failover is able to evaluate the health of the load balancer and the health of the application running on the EC2 instances behind it. In other words, if any part of the stack goes down, Route 53 detects the failure and routes traffic away from the failed endpoint.

For more information on Amazon Route 53 ELB Integration DNS Failover, please visit the following URL:

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-route-53-elb-integration-dns-failover/
 https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/route-53-dns-health-checks/


AWS documentation states that you can create a Route 53 resource record that points to an address outside AWS. You can set up health checks for parts of your application running outside AWS, and you can failover to any endpoint that you choose, regardless of location. 

For example, you may have a legacy application running in a datacenter outside AWS and a backup instance of that application running within AWS. You can set up health checks of your legacy application running outside AWS, and if the application fails the health checks, you can failover automatically to the backup instance in AWS.

Please refer to the following URL for more information:

https://aws.amazon.com/route53/faqs/

Note: 

As per AWS, Route 53 has health checkers in different locations around the world. When you create a health check that monitors an endpoint, health checkers start to send requests to the endpoint that you specify to determine whether the endpoint is healthy. You can choose which locations you want Route 53 to use, and you can specify the interval between checks: every 10 seconds or every 30 seconds. Note that Route 53 health checkers in different data centers don't coordinate with one another, so you'll sometimes see several requests per second regardless of the interval you chose, followed by a few seconds with no health checks at all.
Each health checker evaluates the health of the endpoint based on two values:

Response time
Whether the endpoint responds to a number of consecutive health checks that you specify (the failure threshold)
Route 53 aggregates the data from the health checkers and determines whether the endpoint is healthy:

If more than 18% of health checkers report that an endpoint is healthy, Route 53 considers it healthy.
If 18% of health checkers or fewer report that an endpoint is healthy, Route 53 considers it unhealthy.

The response time that an individual health checker uses to determine whether an endpoint is healthy depends on the type of health check:
HTTP and HTTPS health checks, TCP health checks or HTTP and HTTPS health checks with string matching.

Regarding your specific query where we are having more than 2 servers for the website, AWS docs state that:

When you have more than one resource performing the same function—for example, more than one HTTP server or mail server—you can configure Amazon Route 53 to check the health of your resources and respond to DNS queries using only the health resources. For example, suppose your website, example.com, is hosted on six servers, two each in three data centers around the world. You can configure Route 53 to check the health of those servers and to respond to DNS queries for example.com using only the servers that are currently healthy. The configuration details are provided in the second link.

### You have an application hosted on AWS consisting of EC2 Instances launched via an Auto Scaling Group. You notice that the EC2 Instances are not scaling out on demand. Which checks should be done to ensure that the scaling occurs as expected? [WL231] (Select 2)

A. Ensure that the right metrics are being used to trigger the scale-out. 
B. Check your scaling policies to see whether more than one policy is triggered by an event. 
C. Ensure that AutoScaling health checks are being used. 
D. Ensure that you are using Load Balancers. 


ANSWER : A , B

EXPLANATION: 
There could be a number of reasons as mentioned in AWS Documentation but only options A and B are applicable from the given choices.

Option A is correct because if your scaling events are not based on the right metrics and do not have the right threshold defined, then the scaling will not occur as you want it to happen.

Option B is correct because f two policies are executed at the same time, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling follows the policy with the greater impact. For example, if you have one policy to add two instances and another policy to add four instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling adds four instances when both policies are triggered at the same time.

Option C is incorrect because health checks will help us know the health status of an Auto Scaling instance. It is not a Check if AutoScaling is not working as expected. It is a health check for Instance.

Option D is incorrect because AutoScaling can be used without Load Balancer also.
