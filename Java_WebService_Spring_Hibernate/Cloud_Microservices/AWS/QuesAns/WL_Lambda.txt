You are uploading large files to AWS S3 bucket, ranging from 1GB – 3GB. Your organization has a requirement to calculate the hash checksum of the file by reading entire file so the users can validate the checksum to identify any potential corruptions during downloads. For this, you created a Lambda function and getting it triggered through S3 notifications. However, the request is getting timed out. What could be the reason?

A. Lambda function is configured with minimal memory of 128 MB. ]
B. Lambda function is set to run in a private VPC without NAT Gateway or VPC Endpoint. ]
C. You have not setup S3 bucket name in the environment variable. ]
D. Lambda function is created in a different region than S3 bucket. 


EXPLANATION:
Answer: B

Option A is not correct. If the function reaches the maximum configured memory, in this case

128 MB, the function gets terminated with an error message as below, not as request timed out. 
REPORT RequestId: xxxxxxxx   Duration: xxxxx ms   Billed Duration: xxxxx ms

Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 129 MB RequestId: xxxxxxx Process exited before completing request

 

 Option B is correct. AWS Lambda functions can run within a private VPC with the resources allocated inside the subnet provided during configuration. 
For the lambda function to access S3 service endpoint from within private VPC, there should be a NAT Gateway or S3 VPC Endpoint configured in the route table associated with the subnet which was chosen during Lambda function setup. If not, the request would get timed out. 
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/
Option C is not correct. Bucket need not be configured as environment variable. 
Lambda function environment variables are used to configure additional parameters that can be passed to lambda function. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/env_variables.html

Option D is not correct. As long as Lambda function has internet access, it can access S3 service endpoints irrespective of S3 bucket region. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your organization is having a requirement to perform big data analysis to transform data and store the result in AWS S3 bucket. They have implemented the solution using AWS Lambda due to its zero-administrative maintenance and cost-effective nature. However, in very few cases, the execution is getting abruptly terminated after 15 minutes. They would like to get a notification in such scenarios. What would you do?

A. Setup timer in the code and send notification when the timer reaches 900 seconds.
B. Configure SES for failures under Configuration option in the lambda function.
C. Setup ERROR_NOTIFY environment variable with email address. Lambda function has inbuilt feature to send email during max memory and time out terminations using this environment variable.
D. Configure Dead-letter Queue and send notification to SNS topic



EXPLANATION:
Answer: D

Option A is not correct. Although you can set the timers in the code, it may not be accurate measure to find if the lambda function is terminated after 900 seconds or it just finished executing on 900th second. 
Option B is not correct. There is no option to configure AWS SES within Lambda setup.

Your organization uploads relatively large compressed files ranging between 100MB – 200MB in size to AWS S3 bucket. Once uploaded, they are looking to calculate the total number objects in the compressed file and add the total count as a metadata to the compressed file in AWS S3. They approached you for a cost-effective solution. You have recommended using AWS Lambda through S3 event notifications to perform this operation. However, they were concerned about failures as S3 event notification is an asynchronous one-time trigger and Lambda can fail due to operation time outs, max memory limits, max execution time limits etc. What is the best retry approach you recommend?

A. All the failed events will be logged to CloudWatch. You can manually retrigger failed events. ]
B. Configure Dead-letter queue with SQS. Configure SQS to trigger Lambda function again. ]
C. All failures will be caught during exception inside Lambda function. Trigger lambda function inside lambda function code to process failed event. ]
D. Enable Active tracing using AWS X-Ray. It will automatically retrigger failed events. 

EXPLANATION:
Answer: B

Option A is not recommended approach. Although you can configure logging to CloudWatch, it is difficult to find the specific failure logs. Manual retries are not a best practice in an enterprise level solution designs. 
Option B is correct. You can forward non-processed or failed payloads to Dead Letter Queue

(DLQ) using AWS SQS, AWS SNS.

You have created API methods, Lambda function code and spinned up Oracle RDS instance in a private VPC with no Internet Gateway. When you are trying to connect to RDS instance from your Lambda, connection getting failed. What could be the reason? (choose 2 options)


A. Lambda execution role does not have policy to access RDS instance. 

B. Lambda function is running in “no VPC” network mode. 

C. RDS instance security group is not allowing connections from Lambda subnet range. 

D. RDS instance is not configured as destination in Lambda setup. 


EXPLANATION:
Answer: B, C

Option A is not correct. A policy on the role can only define access to which API actions can be made on RDS instance such as rds:CreateDBInstance, rds:CreateDBSecurityGroup, rds:CreateDBSnapshot etc. The policy will not define whether a resouce can connect to RDS instance or not. Option B is correct. When Lambda function is running in “no VPC” network mode, it will not have access to resources running in a private VPC. 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html
Option C is correct. Security groups act as a firewall for any resources (such as RDS instance and Lambda in this case) they are connected with.

You work for a team which has 10s of applications running on AWS EC2 instances. All these applications would need a common backend processing job. You have created an AWS Lambda function with name “app-backend-job”and published PROD version with version “1” in order to make sure any changes to the function by anyone will not impact the PROD execution code. You have shared the version qualified ARN to all the applications assuming requests would be sent to the specific version. However, due to frequent changes in requirements, you had to change the code of Lambda function many times and keep publishing versions. This is causing a lot of overhead at the application level to update the Lambda function ARN each time you publish a new version. How can you overcome this situation?

A. Create an alias, point it to PROD version and share the ARN with applications. When new version is published, change the alias to point to it. ]
B. Do not publish versions for every code change. Instead, update the published version so that ARN to be invoked will not change. ]
C. Delete the old published version “1” before publishing new version. This way when you publish, you will get the version ID as “1” and the lambda version ARN will remain unchanged. ]
D. Do not use versioning in this case. Always use $LATEST version and share its ARN with applications.You can update the codes of $LATEST version any number of times.

You have a requirement to create an AWS Lambda function inside a private VPC which will be communicating with RDS instance inside the same private VPC. You have set up the memory to be 1 GB for the Lambda function. You expect concurrent requests during peak to be 100 per sec and average Function execution time is 1 sec. 
What should be the minimum subnet range you must choose for creating a subnet to run the Lambda function successfully without any issues?

A.  x.x.x.x/24
B.  x.x.x.x/25
C. x.x.x.x/26
D. x.x.x.x/27



EXPLANATION:
Answer: C

 

 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/vpc.html#vpc-setup-guidelines
 

Peak concurrent executions = 100 * 1 = 100
ENI Capacity = 100 * (1GB / 3GB) = 33.33  i.e. = 33

Hence we need /26 CIDR

 

/24 CIDR range comes with 256 IP address with 251 available IP addresses
/25 CIDR range comes with 128 IP address with 123 available IP addresses. /26 CIDR range comes with 64 IP addresses with 59 available IP addresses. /27 CIDR range comes with 32 IP addresses with 27 available IP addresses.  

A step-by-step guide to ensure your function is optimally configured for scalability:

Calculate your Peak Concurrent Executions with this formula:
Peak Concurrent Executions = Peak Requests per Second * Average Function Duration (in seconds)
Now calculate your Required ENI Capacity:
Required ENI Capacity = Projected peak concurrent executions * (Function Memory Allocation in GB / 3GB)
If Peak Concurrent Executions > Account Level Concurrent Execution Limit (default=1,000), then you will need to ask AWS to increase this limit. Configure your function to use all the subnets available inside the VPC that have access to the resource that your function needs to connect to. This both maximizes Actual ENI Capacity and provides higher availability (assuming subnets are spread across 2+ availability zones). Calculate your Actual ENI Capacity using these steps. If Required ENI Capacity > Actual ENI Capacity, then you will need to do one or more of the following:
Decrease your function’s memory allocation to decrease your Required ENI Capacity. Refactor any time-consuming code which doesn’t require VPC access into a separate Lambda function. Implement throttle-handling logic in your app (e.g. by building retries into a client). If Required ENI Capacity > your EC2 Network Interfaces per region account limit then you will need to request that AWS increase this limit. Consider configuring a function-level concurrency limit to ensure your function doesn’t hit the ENI Capacity limit and also if you wish to force throttling at a certain limit due to downstream architectural limitations. Monitor the concurrency levels of your functions in production using CloudWatch metrics so you know if invocations are being throttled or erroring out due to insufficient ENI capacity. If your Lambda function communicates with a connection-based backend service such as RDS, ensure that the maximum number of connections configured for your database is less than your Peak Concurrent Executions, otherwise, your functions will fail with connection errors. See here for more info on managing RDS connections from Lambda. (kudos to Joe Keilty for mentioning this in the comments)

Which of the following statement is not true with respect to default retry behaviour of AWS Lambda function?

A. With synchronous invocation, the invoking application receives a 429 error and is responsible for retries.
B. With asynchronous invocation, if AWS Lambda is unable to fully process the event and if you don't specify a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), the event will be discarded.
C. With Poll-based (or pull model) event sources that are stream-based, when a Lambda function invocation fails, AWS Lambda attempts to process the erring batch of records until the time the data expires, which can be up to seven days.
D. With Poll-based event sources that are not stream-based, if the invocation fails or times out, the message will be returned to the queue and will be available for invocation once the Visibility Timeout period expires. 


EXPLANATION:
Answer: A

Synchronous invocation – Lambda includes the FunctionError field in the response body, with details about the error in the X-Amz-Function-Error header. The status code is 200 for function errors

Event sources that aren't stream-based – Some of these event sources are set up to invoke a Lambda function synchronously and others invoke it asynchronously. Accordingly, exceptions are handled as follows:

Synchronous invocation – Lambda includes the FunctionError field in the response body, with details about the error in the X-Amz-Function-Error header. The status code is 200 for function errors. Lambda only returns error status codes if there is an issue with the request, function, or permissions that prevents the handler from processing the event. See Invoke Errors for details. 
AWS service triggers can retry depending on the service. If you invoke the Lambda function directly from your application, you can choose whether to retry or not. 
Asynchronous invocation – Asynchronous events are queued before being used to invoke the Lambda function. If AWS Lambda is unable to fully process the event, it will automatically retry the invocation twice, with delays between retries. If you have specified a Dead Letter Queue for your function, then the failed event is sent to the specified Amazon SQS queue or Amazon SNS topic. If you don't specify a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), which is not required and is the default setting, then the event will be discarded. For more information, see Dead Letter Queues.
