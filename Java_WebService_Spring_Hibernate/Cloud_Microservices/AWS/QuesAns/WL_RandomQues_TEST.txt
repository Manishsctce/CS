Which of the following services could be used in this regard. Choose 3 answers from the options given below


A. AWS API Gateway

B. AWS Lambda

C. AWS DynamoDB

D. AWS EC2


EXPLANATION:
Answer - A,B and C

The AWS Documentation mentions the following

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any web application. 
AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. 
Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB lets you offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a distributed database, so that you don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching, or cluster scaling

Your company currently has setup their data store on AWS DynamoDB. One of your main revenue generating applications uses the tables in this service. Your application is now expanding to 2 different other locations and you want to ensure that the latency for data retrieval is the least from the new regions. Which of the following can help accomplish this?

A. Place a cloudfront distribution in front of the database
B. Enable Multi-AZ for DynamoDB
C. Place an ElastiCache in front of DynamoDB
D. Enable global tables for DynamoDB


EXPLANATION:
Answer - D

The AWS Documentation mentions the following

To illustrate one use case for a global table, suppose that you have a large customer base spread across three geographic areas—the US east coast, the US west coast, and western Europe. Customers would need to update their profile information while using your application. To address these requirements, you could create three identical DynamoDB tables named CustomerProfiles, in three different AWS regions. These three tables would be entirely separate from each other, and changes to the data in one table would not be reflected in the other tables. Without a managed replication solution, you could write code to replicate data changes among these tables; however, this would be a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort. 
Option A is incorrect since cloudfront should ideally be used in front of web distributions

Option B is incorrect since this is not an option for DynamoDB

Option C is incorrect since would not be affective for multiple regions
