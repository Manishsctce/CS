## What is Cloud Computing?

Def1: It can be defined as delivering computing power( CPU, RAM, Network Speeds, Storage OS software) a service over a network (usually on the internet) rather than physically having the computing resources at the customer location.

Def2: It is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

## What are the advantages of using cloud computing?

> Lower IT infrastructure and computer costs for users
> Improved performance
> Fewer Maintenance issues
> Instant software updates
> Improved compatibility between Operating systems
> Backup and recovery
> Performance and Scalability
> Increased storage capacity
> Increase data safety
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Explain different models for deployment in cloud computing?

> The different deployment models in cloud computing are
a) Private Cloud
b) Public Cloud
c) Community Cloud
d) Hybrid Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the security aspects provided with cloud?

a) Identity management: 
- It authorizes the application services

b) Access control: 
- permission has to be provided to the users so that they can control the access of another user who is entering into the cloud environment.

c) Authentication and Authorization: 
- Allows only the authorized and authenticated user only to access the data and applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#### Cloud Computing Services

1. Software as a Service(SaaS)
> It is a software distribution model in which app are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network (internet)

2. Platform as a Service(PaaS)
> It provides a platform and environment to allow developers to build applications and services. 
- This service is hosted in the cloud and accessed by the users via internet.

Example - Cloud Foundary, Google Cloud Platform(GCP), PCF etc

3. Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS)
> IaaS provider provides OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
Example - AWS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Explain what are the different modes of software as a service (SaaS)?

a) Simple multi-tenancy :  
- In this each user has independent resources and are different from other users, it is an efficient mode.

b) Fine grain multi-tenancy:  
- In this type, the resources can be shared by many but the functionality remains the same.

## what is diff bet elasticity and scalability in cloud computing?

> Elasticity is a system’s ability to shrink or expand infrastructure resources potentially as required
- It is featured with pay-as-you-expand or pay-per-use services 

> scalability includes the system’s ability to grow workload sizes within pre-existing hardware, software and other related infrastructure in the absence of impacting performance

## Mention some open source cloud computing platform databases?

> The open source cloud computing platform databases are

a) MongoDB
b) CouchDB
c) LucidDB

## Difference between Google Cloud Service(GCS) and Amazon Web Service(AWS)?


## What is Cloud Native?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## 
Virtualization software can be broadly categorized into 2 categories:

1. Class 1 : 
- This is also known as the bare metal virtualization type. 
- Very thin (that is of a small size) virtualization software called a hypervisor is installed directly on the physical server. 
- The AWS cloud uses a customized Xen hypervisor. 
- Class 1 hypervisors are faster than class 2 hypervisors. 
- Examples of class 1 hypervisors are Xen, OpenStack, Hyper-V, and vSphere.

2. Class 2 type: 
- This is also called a hosted hypervisor. 
- These types of hypervisors are installed above the base operating system such as Windows or Linux. 
- Examples: VMware Workstation, VirtualBox, and Virtual PC.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Virtualization types based on virtualization methods


1. OS-level virtualization: 
- Host machines and VMs have the same OS with the same patch level

2. Software virtualization (hypervisor): 
> Binary translation: Sensitive instructions from VMs are replaced by hypervisor calls.
> Para Virtualization Mode (PVM): Guest OS is modified to deliver performance.
> Hardware Assisted Virtual Machine (HVM): 
- Creates an abstract layer between host and guest VMs. 
- Uses special CPU instruction sets (that is, Intel-VT and AMD-V) to boost guest VM performance.

3. Hardware emulation: 
- Makes it possible to run an unsupported OS, such as running Android on a PC:
