##What is collection framework?

> Collection in java is a framework that is use for its unified arch. 
> It represent GROUP OF OBJECT AS AN ELEMENT
> It is used to store,retrieve and manipulate group of objects
>> Collection framework contains group of interface, implementation(classess) & algorithm(predefine action). 
> It is define in java.util package.

Ex - poker hand (a collection of cards), a mail folder (a collection of letters), 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## List out some benefits of Collections framework?

Some of the BENEFITS of collections framework are;
1. REDUCED DEVELOPMENT EFFORT by using core collection classes rather than implementing our own collection classes.
2. INCREASES PROGRAM SPEED AND QUALITY:  provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms. 
	- By which we can USE OUR COLLECTION IN DIFFERENT WAY i.e it provide interchangeability
3. APIs naturally take collections on input and furnish them as output
4. Reusability and Interoperability

> Jdk1.1 - Vector, Stack, Hashtable, Array. 
> Java 1.2 came up with Collections Framework that group all the collections interfaces, implementations and algorithms.
> Jdk1.5 came up with concurrency utility i.e new collection related classes.

> Java Collections uses Generics and Concurrent Collection classes for thread-safe operations. 
> It also includes blocking interfaces and their implementations in java concurrent package.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the basic interfaces of Java Collection Framework?

1. SET is a collection that CANNOT contain duplicate elements. Ex - such as the deck of cards.
> Set <- HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet

2. List is an ordered collection and CAN CONTAIN DUPLICATE ELEMENTS. 
	- You can access any element from its index. 
	- List is more like array with dynamic length.
> List <- ArrayList, Vector, LinkedList,CopyOnWriteArrayList

3. Queue 
> The Java platform doesnt provide any direct implementations of this interface.

> A Map is an object that maps keys to values. 
> A map cannot contain duplicate keys: Each key can map to at most one value.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the classes implementation of List interface?

1. ArrayList - dynamic array, not synch, insertion order, can contain duplicate element, random access
2. Vector - synch, insertion order, can contain duplicate element, random access
3. LinkedList - double linked list, not synch, insertion order, can contain duplicate element, no random access,used for better manipulation
4. CopyOnWriteArrayList - 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##What is the benefit of Generics in Collections Framework?
> Java 1.5 came with Generics.
> Generics allow us to provide the type of Object that a collection can contain.
> ClassCastException at Runtime 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are Collection related features in Java 8?
A: Java 8 has brought major changes in the Collection API. Some of the changes are:

1. Java Stream API for collection classes for supporting sequential as well as parallel processing
2. Iterable interface is extended with forEach() default method that we can use to iterate over a collection. 
- It is very helpful when used with lambda expressions because it’s argument Consumer is a function interface.

3. Miscellaneous Collection API improvements such as forEachRemaining(Consumer action) method in Iterator interface, Map replaceAll(), compute(), merge() methods.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Why Map[i] doesnt extend Collection[i]??

> Map contains key-value pairs and it provides methods to retrieve list of Keys or values as Collection 
> it doesnt fit into the group of elements paradigm.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##What is an Iterable interface? 

> Iterable[i] is extended by Collection[i]. It mean all type of collection can be iterate using iterator()
> The class which need to iterate must implements Iterable[i] which have iterator() that return Iterator 

public interface java.lang.Iterable{
	java.util.Iterator iterator();
	
	//Added in Java8
	default void forEach(Consumer<? super T> arg0) {
		Objects.requireNonNull(arg0);
		Iterator arg1 = this.iterator();

		while (arg1.hasNext()) {
			Object arg2 = arg1.next();
			arg0.accept(arg2);
		}

	}

	//Added in Java8
	default Spliterator<T> spliterator() {
		return Spliterators.spliteratorUnknownSize(this.iterator(), 0);
	}
}
> Since Java8, a default method forEach() is introduce in interable[i] 
Ex- empList.forEach(e -> System.out.println(e.getName))
empList.forEach(System.out::println);//print all employee

> Spliterator stands for Splitable Iterator
> We can use Spliterator to iterate Streams in Parallel and Sequential order.
=========================================
############### ITERATOR ################
public iterface Iterator {
	boolean hasNext();
	E next();
	void remove();
}

## What is an Iterator?
> Iterator is an interface that is used to iterate over collection i.e. step by step movement in collection.
> We can iterate only in 1 DIRECTION

> Iterator makes NO GUARANTEES about the order of iteration that's why it doesn't hv add(). like in set
- It's just iterate over collection. It all depends on what you're iterating over, and the particular implementation.

> Iteration can be done ONLY ONCE. If you reach the end of series its done. 
- If we need to iterate again we should get a new Iterator.

> Iterator can be used as 
1. obtain iterator: Iterator i = collection.iterator();
2. set up loop with i.hasNext() and obtain each element by next()

> Using iterator is more THREAD-SAFE because it makes sure that if underlying list elements are modified, it will throw ConcurrentModificationException.

> Iterator TAKE PLACE of Enumeration bcz many advantages [check below] 
> Iterators ALLOW the caller TO REMOVE ELEMENTS from the underlying collection during the iteration. 

> Java Collection iterator provides a GENERIC WAY FOR TRAVERSAL through the elements of a collection and implements Iterator Design Pattern.

> ListIterator does provide an add operation, as it does guarantee the order of the iteration.
---------------
> next() - NoSuchElementException - if the iteration has no more elements
> remove() - UnsupportedOperationException - if the remove operation is not supported by this iterator
> IllegalStateException - for any illegal steps 
> If the objects in the collection have been modified since the last visited object, an IllegalStateException is thrown by the method.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##What are advantages of iterating a collection using iterator?

> For loop DOES NOT ALLOW UPDATION the collection(remove operation) inside the loop whereas Iterator does. 

> Iterator can be USED WHERE THERE IS NO CLUE what type of collections will be used because all collections have iterator.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### What is different between Iterator and ListIterator?

>> Iterator cn be used to traverse Set and List collections 
- ListIterator can be used with Lists only. It is return by List concrete implementations.

>> Iterator can traverse in FORWARD DIRECTION ONLY 
- ListIterator can be used to traverse in BOTH DIRECTIONS.

> ListIterator inherits from Iterator[i] and comes with EXTRA FUNCTIONALITIES 
- like adding an element, replacing an element, getting index position for previous and next elements.

> Iterator makes no guarantees about order of iteration that's why it doesn't hv add()
- ListIterator does provide an add operation, as it does guarantee the order of the iteration.

>> ListIterator have 9 methods including Iterotor methods - 
- boolean hasNext(),E next(),void remove(),
- boolean hasPrevious(), E previous()
- int nextIndex(),int previousIndex() 
- void set(Obj), void add(Obj)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##What is FAIL-FAST ITERATOR?

> Fail fast is behavior of an iterator 
> while iterating through the collection, it throws ConcurrentModificationException if there is structural modification of the col. 

1. Single Threaded Environment - After the creation of the iterator , structure is modified at any time by any method other than iterator's own remove method.   
2. Multiple Threaded Environment- If one thread is modifying the structure of the collection while other thread is iterating over it .

EXAMPLE: 
Iterator iterator = arrayList.iterator();
while(iterator.hasNext()){
	Object obj = iterator.next();			
	if(obj.equals(1)){
		iterator.remove();
		arrayList.add("new");//throw ConcurrentModificationException
	}
	else
		System.out.println(obj);			
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is FAIL-SAFE ITERATOR?

> it makes copy of internal data structure(object array) and ITERATES OVER THE COPIED DATA STRUCT.
> Any structure modification done to the iterator affects the copied data structure.
- original data structure remains  structurally unchanged .
- Hence , no ConcurrentModificationException throws by fail safe iterator.

Two  issues associated with Fail Safe Iterator are :
1. Overhead of maintaining the copied data structure i.e memory.
2. Fail safe iterator does not guarantee that the data being read is the data currently in the original data structure. 

> Iterator return by CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentHashMap are fail safe.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the nature of iterator? is it fail-fast or fail-safe?

> ArrayList iterator is fail-fast by design. 
- it means once the iterator is created, if the ArrayList is modified, it throws ConcurrentModificationException.
- next() of iterator throws exception because it check for modification count, if doesn't match then throw exception.
> iterator throws ConcurrentModificationException if list size is changed.

final void checkForComodification() {
    if (modCount != expectedModCount)
        throw new ConcurrentModificationException();
}

- here 'modCount' holds the modification count and every time we use add, remove or trimToSize method, it increments. 
- 'expectedModCount' is the iterator variable that is initialized when we create iterator with same value as modCount. 
- This explains why we don’t get exception if we use set method to replace any existing element.
=====================================
############ ENUMERATION ############
##What is Enumeration[i]?

> it defines the methods by which we can enumerate the elements in the collection 
> Vector has a method that return Enumeration . 
- it is internally implementing Enumeration in elements(). 

> Collections class also has a enumeration(), which can enumerate over any collection
- it internally use iterator methods 
- Enumeration e = Collections.enumeration(Collection);

> Enumeration interface has 2 methods
- boolean hasMoreElements( )
- Object nextElement( )

Vector<E> v;
for (Enumeration<E> e = v.elements(); e.hasMoreElements();)
    System.out.println(e.nextElement());
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### What is difference between Enumeration[i] and Iterator[i]?

> Iterator is MORE SECURE AND SAFE as compared to Enumeration because 
- it does not allow other thread to modify the collection object while some thread is iterating over it and throws ConcurrentModificationException.

> Enumeration is older and its there from JDK1.0
>> Iterator has a remove() method while Enumeration doesn't.

>> Enumeration acts as READ-ONLY INTERFACE, bcz it has the methods only to traverse and fetch the objects, 
- but in Iterator we can manipulate the objects like adding and removing the objects from collection e.g. Arraylist.

> Enumeration - boolean hasMoreElement(); Object nextElement(), N/A
> Iterator - boolean hasNext(), E next(), void remove()

=====================================
###### COMPARABLE & COMPARATOR ######
##What is Comparable interface?
> java.lang.Comparable[i] is used TO ORDER the objects of user-defined class and 
- has only 1 method : public int compareTo(Object).

> It provide sorting for only one sequence that for only single datamember.
> list that impl Comparable can be sorted by Collections and Arrays class as
- Collections.sort(List);
- Arrays.sort(array);

> Objects which impl Comparable in java can be used as keys in a SortedMap like TreeMap or SortedSet like TreeSet without implementing any other interface.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Comparator[i]?

> Comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined class.
> Comparator has 2method: 
- int compare(Object obj1,Object obj2) & 
- boolean equals(Object element)
Note: that it is always safe not to override Object.equals(Object).

>> It is used when a class cannot be modifyable
> It provides multiple sorting sequence
> The list that implement Comparator[i] can be sorted by Collections and Arrays class as
- Collections.sort(List list, Comparator c);

EXAMPLE:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### What is DIFFERENCE between Comparable[i] and Comparator[i]?

> In Comparable, sorting logic must be in same class that obj to be sorted and must implement Comparable[i] 
- in Comparator, sorting logic can be in different class and implement Comparator[i]

> Comparable provides only one sort of sequence.
> Comparator provides multiple sort of sequences.

> Comparable has 1 method: int compareTo() and 
- Comparator has 2methods: compare(Object obj1,Object obj2) & equals(Object ele)

> Comparable define in java.lang package
- Comparator in java.util

> If we implement Comparable[i], actual class is modified. but not in Comparator.

> compareTo() : 0 for equal, -1 for smaller, 1 for greater
=====================================
######### COLLECTIONS CLASS #########
##What is COLLECTIONS CLASS?
> it is introduce in jdk1.2
> java.util.Collections class is a utility class that is use to operate on collection. 
> hving private constructor so not initialize
> Operation can be of sorting, synchronization, binary search, shuffling etc.

Collections methods:-
1. public static <T extends Comparable<? super T>> void sort(List<T> list)
	- Here list must implement Comparable interface

2. public static <T> void sort(List<T> list,Comparator<? super T> c)
3. static Collection unmodifiableCollection(Collection col1)
4. static Collection synchronizedCollection(Collection col1) 
5. static void reverse(List list1)
6. static void shuffle(List list1)
7. static void swap(List list1, int index1, int index2)

8. static void copy(List dest1, List source1): 
	-Copies all the ele of List source1 into the dest1 list 
9. static void fill(List list1, Object obj1): 
	-Replaces all the elements of list1 with obj1. 
	-Earlier elements are lost. 

10. static int binarySearch(List list1, Object obj1): 
	- Searches the obj1 in the list list1. Returns the index number of the element obj1. 
	- elements must be sorted earlier with sort() method; else unexpected results with execu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##What is the difference between Collection and Collections?

> java.util.Collection is an interface whereas java.util.Collections is a class. 
> Collections class is use to sort and synchronize collection elements as 
- public void sort(List list); list ele must be comparable type

> for user-define class obj it should implement Comparable interface otherwise throw ClassCastException
> All wrapper class implements comparable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##How to make a collection read only?
> Collections class provide 6 methods 1 for each of Collection, List, Map, Set, SortedMap, and SortedSet. As below :

- Collections.unmodifiableList(list); return List
- Collections.unmodifiableSet(set); return Set
- Collections.unmodifiableMap(map);

> After collection = Collections.unmodifiableXXX(collection);
collection.add("String"); // throw UnsupportedOperationException

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##What is UnsupportedOperationException?
> This exception is thrown on invoked methods which are not supported by actual collection type.

> For ex, 
- take READ-ONLY LIST using Collections.unmodifiableList(list) 
- then call add() or remove() -> throw UnsupportedOperationException.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##What is the difference between Collections.sort() and Arrays.sort()?
> Collections.sort() internally call Arrays.sort() so algorithm wise both are same.
> Only difference is the input 
> Merge sort algo is used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Arrays class?
> utility class hving private constructor so not initialize
> contains various method like binarySearch(), sort(), fill(), hashCode(), toString() etc to enhance the spead
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
##### EMPTY COLLECTION #####
> returning an instance of list/set is adding an extra cost without any elements. Its better to return EMPTY_LIST/EMPTY_SET/EMPTY_MAP 

> EMPTY_LIST/EMPTY_SET/EMPTY_MAP return the empty list/set/map
> it return the unmodifiable collection
> emptyXxx() methods actually returns the EMPTY_XXX fields.
> List immutableEmptyList=Collections.unmodifiableList(new ArrayList()); 
>> The field gives you a non type-safe empty immutable object where are the method return type-safe empty immutable object of collection 

=============================
### Why Collection doesnt extend Cloneable[i] and Serializable[i]?

> Collection is an ABSTRACT REPRESENTATION of a group of objects. 
- The details of how the group of elements is maintained is left up to the concrete implementations of Collection.  For example, List allow duplicate ele whereas Set don't
- However, it does't really make sense to include it in all implementations of Collection. This is because Collection is an abstract representation
- the concrete implementation should decide how it should be cloned or serialized, or even if it can be cloned or serialized

> So MANDATING it will be actually LESS FLEXIBLE AND MORE RESTRICTIVE. 
> A lot of the Collection implementations have a public clone method.
