## What is THREAD?

> It is a SINGLE SEQUENTIAL FLOW OF CONTROL WITHIN A PROGRAM. 
> It is a lightweight process or we can say it is a PART OF A PROCESS. 
> It is a worker who is doing some task.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Why do we need thread?

> to increase processor utilisation over monolithic pgm that have only 1 process and it execute sequence of code.
- To avoid microprocessor sit idle, a process is divide into number of thread that hv responsibility of some block of statement

> Runnable is implemented by class Thread.

> THREAD SHARE - 
1. addr space, 
2. heap area(instance variable it store dynamic obj), 
3. share CLASS/METHOD AREA(stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field and method data i.e class variable), 
4. file 

> Each thread has Separate - Java stack , PC register
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Process ?

> It is a program which execute some code. 
- It can be single threaded or multithreaded.
> It has separate address space
Example - JVM, any application etc 
> context switching between processes are slow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is difference between thread and process?

> A process need execution environment i.e. provided by OS, it has its own set of Address space and private resources (e.g. memory, open files, etc.) whereas
- Threads exist as subsets of a process, it share its Address space, data(heap) and files. 

> Processes use IPC(interprocess communication) to communicate with sibling processes (like RMI, CORBA, socket pgrm,JMX)
- Threads can directly communicate with each other of a process using wait-and-notify-methods 

> In Process, context switching between processes are slow whereas
> context switching between threads in the same process is typically faster.

> New processes require duplication of the parent process.
- New threads are easily created;

> Processes can only exercise control there child processes.
- Threads have considerable control over other threads of the same process; 

> Any changes in parent process doesn't affect its child processes 
- Changes to the main thread (cancellation, priority change, etc.) may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process; 

> Ex - In Java, processes correspond to a running Java Virtual Machine (JVM) whereas 
threads live within the JVM and can be created and stopped by the Java application dynamically at runtime.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How to two JVM communicate with each other?

> Two JVM mean two process and process use IPC(Interprocess comm.) to communicate.
> It can use any 1 of the following
1. Socket-Based programming
2. RMI
3. Message Passing Architectures (ActiveMQ, EMS)
4. Java Management Extensions (JMX)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How two Thread can communicate with each other?

> we can use wait-and-notify-methods for communication between threads.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which JVM parameter is used to control stack size of thread?

> we can use '-Xss' parameter to control stack size of thread 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Concurrency?

> Concurrency is the ability of a program to EXECUTE SEVERAL COMPUTATIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. 
> This can be achieved by distributing the computations over the available CPU cores of a machine or 
- even over different machines within the same network.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is difference bet Multithreading and Concurrency?

> Both are same
> Multithreading means use of multiple thread on sth.
> Concurrency is the use of threads to attempt multiple tasks simultaneously 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What do you mean by multi-threading? What are the advantage of it?

> Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.

> It has many advantages like:

1. RESPONSIVENESS: In multithread, sys is responsive to input but in single-threaded pgm, main exec thread blocks entire appl appear freeze. 

2. FASTER EXECUTION: MT pgm operate faster on multi-core CPU but it is not in case of ST

3. BETTER SYSTEM UTILIZATION - not idle

4. Simplified sharing and communication: Unlike processes, require message passing or shared memory in IPC. 
> Threads automatically share the data, code and files and so, communication is vastly simplified.

5. LOWER RESOURCE CONSUMPTION: Using MT, appl serve multiple client concurrently using less resource than using MP. 
- Ex - Apache HTTP server use a pool of listener and server threads for listening to incoming requests.

6. PARALLELIZATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### Where we use multithreading concept?

> To achieve multiple tasks parallel, we uses threads
- One task does not wait for another to complete.
- Ex - multiple objects in games like cars, motor bikes, animals, people etc
- Ex - Railway ticket reservation system where multiple customers accessing the server.

> It is used when we have same process multiple time then we create thread and each thread will do the operation.
> It is used when we have situation of producer and consumer 

> One CPU can work on one Thread at a time (unless CPUs have hyper-threading,it can handle two at a time). 
- if computer has 4 CPUs with hyper-threading technologies, it could potentially handle 8 Threads at the same time. 
=====================================
## What is difference between user Thread and DAEMON Thread?

> The thread which we create in java is USER THREAD 
- DAEMON THREAD is service provider thread that provide service to other thread. 

> Daemon thread runs in background, mostly created by JVM for background task like Garbage Collection and other house keeping tasks 
> Daemon thread is low priority thread compare to user thread.

> JVM DOESNOT WAIT FOR TERMINATION of Daemon thread to complete. 'finally' blocks are not called
> JVM terminates the daemon thread if there is no user thread.

>> Note : Thread inherit the nature of parent thread. So, Thread create by daemon thread will be daemon. Similar for user thread too.
> We can explicitly define any user thread as daemon thread using setDaemon(true).

- IllegalThreadException
> We cannot set a live thread as daemon. it throw IllegalThreadStateException.

> Main thead is not daemon thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Is it possible to convert a normal user thread into a daemon thread after it has been started?
> No, can causes a IllegalThreadStateException.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Explain different ways of creating a thread?

Thread can be created by 
1. by extending Thread class 
2. by implementing Runnable interface we can make any class runnable that require Thread to run
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Which way of creating thread is preferable and why?

> Creating thread BY IMPLEMENTING RUNNABLE INTERFACE IS PREFERABLE
- We can extends other class with the class implementing Runnable interface
- In OOP, extending a class generally mean adding new feature or modifying existing feature in our subclass. 
- But it is not the case with extending Thread

> By extending the Thread class, each of thread creates the unique object and associates with it while 
- implementing the Runnable interface; multiple threads share the same object 
=====================================
############# Runnable[i] ###########
> The Runnable interface should be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. 
- It have only 1 method 
interface Runnable{
	public abstract void run();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-
## What properties does each Java thread have?

Each Java thread has the following properties:
1. THREAD ID - positive long number generated when thread is create. 
- it is unique within the JVM and remains unchanged during its lifetime. 
- When a thread is terminated, this thread ID may be reused
- we can get it using getId() Since 1.5

2. NAME of type String

3. PRIORITY of type int
- MIN_PRIORITY =1; NORM_PRIORITY=5; MAX_PRIORITY=10,
- throw IllegalArgumentException, if priority set <0 & >10
- if we set priority of thread is greater than thread group priority then new priority of thread will be equal to threadgroup priority.

  if (newPriority > g.getMaxPriority()) {
      newPriority = g.getMaxPriority();
  }

4. STATE of type Enum Thread.State
- private volatile int threadStatus = 0;

5. ThreadGroup - to which the thread belongs to.

=======================================
######### THREAD PRIORITY #############

=======================================
############ THREAD GROUP #############
## What is ThreadGroup?

> ThreadGroup is a class that is used to represent a group of thread.
> Each thread belongs to a ThreadGroup. 
> A ThreadGroup can also include other thread groups. 

> It PROVIDE METHODS TO CONTROL the GROUP of thread like set priority, interrupt etc
> The thread groups FORM A TREE in which every thread group except the initial thread group has a parent.
> A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread group, but 
- not to access information about its thread group's parent OR any other thread groups.

# 2 CONSTRUCTOR # 
ThreadGroup(String name) - here name is the threadgroup name 
- here parent thread name will be the creating thread name.

ThreadGroup(ThreadGroup parent, String name) - here name is the threadgroup name and parent is another threadgroup

EXAMPLE :-
ThreadGroup squares = new ThreadGroup("Squares");
  Thread t1 = new Thread(squares, new T(), "t1"); 
  Thread t2 = new Thread(squares, new T(), "t2");
  
## METHODS ##
1. int activeGroupCount() 
> Returns an estimate of the number of active groups in this thread group.

2. void list()
> Prints information about this thread group to the standard output.

3. String getName ()
> return the main thread's thread group name.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
=======================================
########## THREAD LIFECYCLE ###########

### What are different states in lifecycle of Thread?

> we have 6 different states of thread and it is of type Enum in Thread class
public enum State

1. NEW - A thread that has not yet started is in this state.
- When we create new thread it is in Newborn state i.e Thread t = new Thread()

2. RUNNABLE - A thread in the runnable state is executing in the JVM but it may be waiting for other resources from OS such as processor/scheduler to start.
- thead enter into this state using t.start().
- a new stack is allocated to thread while calling t.start().

3. BLOCKED - A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock

4. WAITING - A thread that is WAITING INDEFINITELY for another thread to perform a particular action is in this state
- thread is alive but not runnable in this state
- Thread is in this state due to calling of these method: Object.wait(), Thread.join(), LockSupport.park()

5. TIMED_WAITING : A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in this state.
> A thread is in the timed waiting state due to calling one of the following methods with a specified positive waiting time:
- Thread.sleep(); Object.wait(timeout); Thread.join(timeout); LockSupport.parkNanos; LockSupport.parkUntil

6. TERMINATED - A thread is in this state when thread finishes its execution i.e.run() execution completes 
> it is also said as dead state. 
> A dead state can not be started again. 
> If start() is invoked on a dead thread, a runtime exception will occur.

> A  thread can be in only one state at a given point in time. 
- These states are virtual machine states which do not reflect any operating system thread states.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are different ways in which a thread can enter the waiting state?

> A thread can enter the waiting state by the following ways:

1. Invoking its sleep() method,
2. By blocking on I/O
3. By unsuccessfully attempting to acquire an object lock
4. By invoking an object’s wait() method.
5. It can also enter the waiting state by invoking its (deprecated) suspend() method

=====================================
########### THREAD METHODS ##########
public void start(), run();
public static void sleep(), yield() 
public static boolean isAlive();
public final join(); stop()[D], suspend()[D], resume()[D]

Thread class methods all methods are public
- void run(): perform action for a thread.
- void start(): starts exec thread. JVM calls the run() method on the thread.
- void sleep(long miliseconds): Causes the thread to sleep
- void join():waits for a thread to die.
- void join(long miliseconds): waits for a thread to die for the specified miliseconds.
- int getPriority(): returns the priority of the thread.
- int setPriority(int priority):changes the priority of the thread.
- String getName():returns the name of the thread.
- void setName(String name):changes the name of the thread.
- Thread currentThread():returns the reference of currently executing thread.
- int getId():returns the id of the thread.
- Thread.State getState():returns the state of the thread.
- boolean isAlive():tests if the thread is alive.
- void yield():causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.
- void suspend():is used to suspend the thread(depricated).
- void resume():is used to resume the suspended thread(depricated).
- void stop():is used to stop the thread(depricated).
- boolean isDaemon():tests if the thread is a daemon thread.
- void setDaemon(boolean b):marks the thread as daemon or user thread.
- void interrupt():interrupts the thread.
- boolean isInterrupted():tests if the thread has been interrupted.
- static boolean interrupted(): tests if the current thread has been interrupted.

> if a thread terminate it cnt be restarted like t1.start() cant define 2 time 
> run() - it contain body of thread execution. it is similar to main() for thread and can pass args using static instance
> notify() - wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
=======================================
############# START() #################

## Why we need start() to execute a thread?
## Difference between start() and run() of Thread class? 

> start() is used to spawn a new thread
- basically it create a separate stack for the thread and call run() internally
- if we use run() then it will be like calling a method from the current stack, it will not create thread.

> start() can be call only once but 
- run() can be call multiple time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## can we override the start() ?

> Yes, we can override start(), but to spawn a new thread super.start() need to invoke
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What will happen if we start a thread twice?

- If we try to start a thread twice, IllegalThreadStateException will be thrown.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How on start of a thread twice, JVM throws IllegalThreadStateException?

> Thread maintains threadStatus whose value initialy is 0 and once the thread is completed its value is 2.
- if start found the threadStatus !=0 then throw IllegalThreadStateException
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Can an already stopped thread be stopped?
yes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### How to stop thread in Java?

> After Java1.0, it doesn't provide any method to stop thread
- stop(), suspend() and resume() are deprecated.

> To manually stop a thread, we can TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VOLATILE BOOLEAN VARIABLE and check in every iteration if run method has loops or interrupt threads to abruptly cancel tasks.
EXAMPLE:
class Server implements Runnable{ 
  private volatile boolean exit = false; 
  public void run() { 
  	while(!exit){ 
  		System.out.println("Server is running....."); 
  	} 
  	System.out.println("Server is stopped...."); 
  } 
  
  public void stop(){ 
  	exit = true; 
  } 
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Can main thread dies before the child thread?

> Yes. Main thread dies after completing its job even after the thread created by main thread is not yet completed.
=======================================
######### SLEEP() / SUSPEND() #########

#### How Thread Sleep Works internally?

> Thread.sleep() interacts with the OS thread scheduler to put the current thread in wait state for specified period of time. 
- the scheduler does maintain an explicit table saying what process is running
- which ones are waiting to run when CPU cycles are available, and which are not even trying to run (sleeping). 
- The scheduler typically assigns even-sized time slices to processes depending on their priority and their execution history. 
- Ultimately, this loop is driven by hardware interrupts, usually generated by an oscillator on the main board.
- So we can say that, the actual time of current thread sleep depends on the OS thread scheduler.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### Can we use Thread.sleep() for real-time processing? If No, then why?

> No, Thread.sleep() is not recommended for real-time processing.
> It's because 

- It doesn't release the lock
- It doesn't gurantee that the execution will start after sleeping time (So it may keep waiting forever - obviously a rare case)
- If we mistakenly put a foreground processing thread on sleep then we wouldn't be able to close that application till x milliseconds.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### What is the difference between wait() and sleep()?	

> Wait is called on an object, not a thread; 
- Sleep is call on currently executing thread 

> wait() - move thread from running state -> WAITING state until another thread invokes notify() or notifyAll() 
> Sleep() - move thread running state -> TIMED_WAITING state
-  If another thread calls t.interrupt() it will wake up the sleeping thread

>> wait() RELEASES THE LOCK or monitor while 
- sleep() doesnt releases any lock or monitor if it call in synchro context while waiting

> Wait is used for ITC while 
- sleep is used to introduce pause on execution

> wait is called from synchronized context only otherwise it will throw IllegalMonitorStateException while 
- sleep can be called without synchronized block

> wait is NON STATIC METHOD and 
- Sleep is static method

> InterruptedException is checked exception so sleep()/wait() must be in try-catch block or method throws exception
- public static native void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException;
- public final void wait() throws InterruptedException

> Its possible to send other threads into suspended state by making a suspend() call. 
- This may cause deadlocks thts why deprecated.

> Once the wait time is over using sleep(), thread state is changed to runnable state and wait for the CPU for further execution. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the difference between public static yield() and public static sleep()?

>> When a task invokes yield(), it RETURNS TO RUNNABLE STATE, either from waiting, running or after its creation. 
- it allows the current thread to RELEASE ITS LOCK from the object and scheduler gives the lock of the object to the other thread with same priority.

> When a task invokes its sleep(), it RETURNS TO WAITING STATE from a running state.
> sleep() allows the thread to go to sleep state for x milliseconds. 
- When a thread goes into sleep state it DOESN’T RELEASE THE LOCK.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Why yield() and sleep() are static?

> Thread sleep() and yield() work on the currently executing thread. 
- So there is no point in invoking these methods on some other threads that are in wait state.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### What is Thread Scheduler? 

> Thread Scheduler is the OS/JVM service (depend on JVM implementation) that allocates the CPU time to the available runnable threads. 
- Once we create and start a thread, it’s execution depends on the implementation of Thread Scheduler. 
- There is no guarantee that which runnable thread will be chosen to run by the thread scheduler.
- The thread scheduler mainly uses preemptive or time slicing scheduling to schedule the threads.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is Time Slicing?

> Time Slicing is the process to divide the available CPU time to the available runnable threads. 
- Allocation of CPU time to threads can be based on thread priority 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### What is difference between preemptive scheduling and time slicing?

> PREEMPTIVE-priority SCHEDULING : 
- This algorithm schedules threads based on their priority relative to other Runnable threads.
- The highest priority task executes until it enters the waiting or dead stated or another higher priority task comes into existence.
- if any high priority thread comes then current running thread will be pre-empted from the Running state, and this highest priority thread will get time slice.

> Algorithms based on preemptive scheduling are: Round Robin (RR),Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority (preemptive version), etc.

> TIME SLICING: A task executes for a predefined slice of time and then enter into the pool of ready tasks. 
- The scheduler then determines which task should execute next, based on priority and other factor.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### What is difference between PREEMPTIVE(PES) and NON-PREEMPTIVE(NPES) scheduling?

> In PES, the CPU is allocated to the processes for the limited time whereas 
- in NPES, the CPU is allocated to the process till it terminates or switches to waiting state.

> In PES, executing process is interrupted in the middle of execution when higher priority one comes whereas, 
- in NPES, the executing process is not interrupted in the middle of execution and wait till its execution.

> In PES, If a process having high priority frequently arrives in the ready queue, low priority process may starve.
- in NPES, If a process with long burst time is running CPU, then later coming process with less CPU burst time may starve.

> In PES, Examples are Round Robin and Shortest Remaining Time First.
- in NPES,Examples are First Come First Serve and Shortest Job First.
=======================================
############### JOIN() ################
## What is join()?

> It is use to waits for the completion of the invoked thread.
- it returns as soon as thread is considered "not alive". 

1. public final synchronized void join()
2. public final synchronized void join(long millis) 
- Waits for the completion of the specified thread, but no longer than the timeout
- it DOESNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE CURRENT THREAD WILL WAIT ONLY FOR GIVEN TIME

EXAMPLE:
public class JoinExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException{        
    Thread t1 = new Thread( new Runnable() { public void run() {
      System.out.println("Thread : "+Thread.currentThread().getName());               
      }}, "t1");
        
    Thread t2 = new Thread(()-> System.out.println("Thread : "+Thread.currentThread().getName()), "t2");
                  
    t1.start();                
    t1.join();
         
    t2.start();                     
    t2.join();           
  }
}

OUTPUT:
Thread : t1
Thread : t2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### How Thread.join() internally works?

> join() is synchro, so it acquire lock on thread obj for join()

> It basically accomplishes the task as the combination of the sleep() and isAlive()
> It does not affecting the thread on which it call

public final synchronized void join(long millis)
throws InterruptedException {
  long base = System.currentTimeMillis();
  long now = 0;

  if (millis < 0) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("timeout value is negative");
  }

  if(millis == 0) {
    while (isAlive()) {
       wait(0);
    }
  }else {
    while (isAlive()) {
      long delay = millis - now;
      if (delay <= 0) {
        break;
      }
      wait(delay);
      now = System.currentTimeMillis() - base;
    }
  }
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What happens when we call join() for a thread that was stopped a long time ago?

> if the thread is already stopped, it will return immediately
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### You have thread T1, T2 and T3, how will you ensure that thread T2 run after T1 and thread T3 run after T2?

> We can use thread.join() 
> call t1.join() just before another thread(t2). It ensure that t1 will dead before t2 start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is difference bet wait() and join()?

> both are present in different packages, 
- wait() is in java.lang.Object while join() is in java.lang.Thread class.

> wait() is used for inter-thread communication while 
- join() is used for adding sequencing between multiple threads.

> We can start a waiting thread by using notify() and notifyAll() but 
- we can not break the waiting imposed by join without unless or interruption the thread on which join is called has execution finished.

> wait() must be called from synchronized context otherwise IllegalMonitorStateException 
- join() can be called, with and without synchronized context.
=======================================
############# INTERRUPT ###############

## Difference between interrrupted() and isInterrupted() ?

>> The interrupt mechanism is implemented using an internal flag called interrupt status. 
> Interrupting a thread by calling Thread.interrupt() sets this flag. 
> When interrupted thread checks for an interrupt by invoking the static method Thread.interrupted(), interrupt status is cleared. 
> The non-static isInterrupted(), which is used by one thread to query the interrupt status of another, does not change the interrupt status flag. 
> By convention, any method that exits by throwing an InterruptedException clears interrupt status when it does so.

=======================================
############# QUESTION ################

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Is there any relationship between threads like parent-child? 

> When you start a thread it inherits the,
- Thread daemon property and Thread priority
- from the "parent" thread to "child" thread and that is the only relationship between threads and NO OTHER RELATION EXIST AFTER THREAD STARTS.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How to Get name of current method in Java?

> String methodName = Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()[1].getMethodName();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## If there is more than one thread waiting on a specific monitor/object, the choice on which thread will receive the notification is arbitrary( i.e there is no way to specify which waiting thread should be re-awakend)
NO 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How threads communicate with each other?

> Threads use wait-and-notify-methods on an object to communicate.
> A thread hold lock on an object and when wait() is called on the object by thread that release the lock and it waits for another thread to release object monitor by calling notify() or notifyAll() method on that object. This is how threads communication is possible.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Why to use any object to communicate if thread obj has it own monitor?

> Synchronization on object won’t be possible 
- Because object has monitor, one object can have multiple threads and thread hold lock on object by holding object monitor. 
- But if each thread will have monitor, we won’t have any way of achieving synchronization.
- each thread will work independently and never communicate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How can we check if a Thread holds a lock or not?

> public static boolean holdsLock(Object obj) in java.lang.Thread return true 
- if the current thread hold the monitor lock on the specified object.
> NullPointerException if the object is null
=======================================
######### THREAD EXCEPTIONS ###########
## What happens when an Exception occurs in a thread?

> the thread that raised the exception will silently die
> It can be caught if we use any ThreadGroup that handle UncaughtException

EXAMPLE:- 
public class MyThreadGroup extends ThreadGroup {
    public MyThreadGroup() {
        super("My Thread Group");
    }
    public void uncaughtException(Thread t, Throwable ex) {
        // Handle exception
    }
}
Thread t = new Thread(new MyThreadGroup(), "My Thread") { ... };
t.start();
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is difference between InvalidMonitorStateException and IllegalMonitorStateException?

> InvalidMonitorStateException is thrown when we call to wait()/notify()/notifyAll() any of these methods for an Object that is not locked
> IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown when we call to wait()/notify()/notifyAll() any of these methods for an Object that is locked

Since T2 thread is first in the queue of waiting it acquires the lock and starts processing.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What happens if a thread throws an Exception inside synchronized block?
> 
=======================================
############# VOLATILE ################
- [more detail in java_basic]
 
## What is volatile variable ?

> VOLATILE keyword guaranteed that any thread that reads the field will see the MOST RECENTLY WRITTEN VALUE.
> it WILL NOT PERFORM ANY MUTUAL EXCLUSIVE LOCK
> Volatile keyword can ONLY APPLIED TO VARIABLEs. 
> Using volatile keyword along with class and method is compiler error.
> volatile variable can hold null 
> Volatile variable can be primitive or object refrence

EXPLANATION
> When multiple threads using the same variable, each thread will have its own copy of the local cache for that variable.
- So, when it’s updating the value, it is actually updated in the local cache not in the main variable memory. 
- To avoid this problem, we declare variable as volatile, then it will not be stored in the local cache. It is updated to the main memory. 

Use volatile variable:
1. used when a variable is shared between multiple threads.
2. it CAN BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE OF SYNCHRONIZATION. As it guaranted that all reader thread will see updated value and it never lock the variable 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is false sharing in the context of multi-threading? i=

> false sharing is one of the well-known performance issues on multi-core systems, 
- where each process has its local cache. 

> It occurs when threads on different processor modify variables that reside on same local cache.
- It can be avoid using volatile keyword
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are differences between volatile and synchronized? i=

> VOLATILE IS A FIELD/VARIABLE MODIFIER, IT CANNOT USE FOR METHOD while 
- SYNCHRONIZED USED FOR CODE BLOCKS AND METHODS, IT CANNOT USE FOR VARIABLE

> Volatile does not acquire any lock on variable or object, but 
- Synchronization acquires lock on method or block in which it is used.

> Volatile variables are not cached, but 
- variables used inside synchronized method or block are cached.

> When volatile is used will never create deadlock in program, as volatile never obtains any kind of lock . 
- But in case if synchronization is not done properly, we might end up creating dedlock in program

> volatile is not expensive in terms of performance while
- synchronization can be expensive as because one thread might be waiting for another thread to release lock on the object.

> volatile variable can hold null value  
> Attempting to synchronize on a null object will throw a NullPointerException.

=====================================
########## BEST PRACTICE ############

> try to use volatile variables. If a field is declared volatile all threads see a consistent value for the variable.
> Final variables are thread safe
> Usage of local variables : If possible try to use local variables, local variables are thread safe, because every thread has its own stack, i.e. every thread has its own local variables

> avoid using deadlock prone deprecated thread methods such as destroy(), stop(), suspend() and resume().

> use VisualVM  or jstack  to detect problems such as deadlocks and time taken by threads to complete in multi threading programs.
