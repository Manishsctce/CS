=======================================
############# HIBERNATE 5 #############
01. Support classes of the Date and Time API as BasicTypes
- Hibernate automatically maps the LocalDate[c] to a JDBC DATE and persists it in the database

02. Get query results as a Stream
EXAMPLE : 
Stream<Object[]> books = session.createNativeQuery("SELECT b.title, b.publishingDate FROM book b").stream();
- It fetches the result set in multiple batches and uses Hibernateâ€™s ScrollableResults implementation to scroll through it.

03. Fetch multiple entities by their primary key
EXAMPLE:
MultiIdentifierLoadAccess<Book> multi = session.byMultipleIds(Book.class);
List<Book> books = multi.multiLoad(1L, 2L, 3L);
- Hibernate creates one query for this method call and provides the 3 primary keys as parameters to an IN statement.

04. Join unassociated entities in a query
