> two main concepts of security are authentication and authorization. 

#### AUTHENTICATION ####
> It is the process by which users' access privileges are verified prior to their entering a Website's protected area. 
There are two major authentication approaches: 
1. basic authentication and 
2. form-based authentication.



> When specifying SECURITY ROLE NAMES, observe the following conventions and restrictions:

1. Do not use blank spaces, commas, hyphens, or any characters in this comma-separated list: \t, < >, #, |, &, ~, ?, ( ), { }.

2. Security role names are case sensitive.

3. The suggested convention for security role names is that they be singular.

<login-config> tag

- the security realm to which the security constraints will be applied

EXAMPLE:

<web-app>
  <welcome-file-list>
       <welcome-file>welcome.jsp</welcome-file>
  </welcome-file-list>
  
  <security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
              <web-resource-name>Success</web-resource-name>
              <url-pattern>/welcome.jsp</url-pattern>
             <http-method>GET</http-method>
             <http-method>POST</http-method>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
            <role-name>webuser</role-name> 
        </auth-constraint>
  </security-constraint>
  <login-config>
      <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
      <realm-name>default</realm-name>
  </login-config>
  <security-role>
      <role-name>webuser</role-name>
  </security-role>
</web-app>

> we can define one or more security roles and map them to security constraints
- we can define any number of security roles
