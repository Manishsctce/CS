############ Kotlin Class #############

> It is similar to Java class
SYNTAX: 
class className{   // class header  
      // property  
      // member function  
}

> class className is an empty constructor. 
- It is generated by compiler automatically but 
- if we want to provide a constructor, we need to write a constructor keyword followed by class name as:

class className constructor(){   // class header  
      // property  
      // member function  
} 

> In Kotlin, property must be initialize or declare as abstract

## CREATE OBJECT
var obj1 = className()  
=======================================
############ Nested class #############
> In Kotlin, nested class is by default static, so its data member and member function can be accessed without creating an object of class. Nested class cannot be able to access the data member of outer class.
