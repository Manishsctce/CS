## What is MANIFEST.MF file?
> it is a file MANIFEST.MF that contain information about the files packaged in a JAR file. 
- using it we can define which package we want to export or import define in another jar.
- we can define which version of JRE can be use to run the code.
- By tailoring this "meta" information that the manifest contains, you enable the JAR file to serve a variety of purposes	

- manifest's entries are in the form of "header: value" pairs

DEFAULT ENTRIES
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: 1.7.0_06 (Oracle Corporation)

> we can define application's entry point in MANIFEST.MF as 
Main-Class: classname

EXAMPLE:
Main-Class: MyPackage.MyClass

> Create jar as 
- jar cfm MyJar.jar Manifest.txt MyPackage/*.class

> Use JAR entry point setting ('e') to specify the application entry point without editing or creating the manifest file.

EXAMPLE:
jar cfe Main.jar foo.Main foo/Main.class

## Class-Path
> By using the Class-Path header in the manifest, you can avoid having to specify a long -classpath flag when invoking Java to run the your application.
