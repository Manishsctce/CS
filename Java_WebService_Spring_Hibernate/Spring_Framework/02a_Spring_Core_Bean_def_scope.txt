############ SPRING BEAN #############

## What is a Spring Bean?

> ANY OBJECT in the Spring framework that we INITIALIZE THROUGH SPRING CONTAINER IS CALLED SPRING BEAN. 
- Any normal Java POJO class can be a Spring Bean if it’s configured to be initialized via container by providing configuration metadata information

> it is a POJO class that can implement spring interfaces like InitializingBean, DisposableBean, BeanNameAware
> It SHOULD CONTAIN DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR other than parameterize container.
> it should contain setter method to set the value given in xml file and support DI 
- otherwise throw org.springframework.beans.NotWritablePropertyException

> it can contain the implementation method and other utility method
> it's life cycle managed by Spring IoC container
> it is created with configuration metadata i.e. xml file that you supply to the container
- For example, in the form of XML <bean/> definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What does a Spring Bean definition contain?

> Bean definition contains the information called CONFIGURATION METADATA, which is needed for the container to know the following :
- How to create a bean
- Bean's lifecycle details
- Bean's dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How can you configure any class as a Spring Bean?

> We can configure any java class to Spring Bean by following three ways:

1. XML Configuration:
> the bean element can be used in the context file to configure a Spring Bean.

2. Java Based Configuration :
> The beans can also be configured by using @Bean annotations. 
- It is used with @Configuration classes through which you can configure the bean. 

3. Annotation Based Configuration:
> We can use @Service, @Component, @Controller and @Repository with the normal java classes if we want to configure them as a Bean. 
- To provide such annotation the base package class location has to be specified for these classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How to Create Bean using Java Based Config Annotation in Spring?

> Annotate a class with @Configuration so that the class can be used by "AnnotationConfigApplicationContext" container as a source of bean definitions.
- Annotate a method with @Bean that create instance of the Spring bean and return it.

EXAMPLE:
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  @Bean
  public Service service() {
    return new ServiceImpl();
  }
}

SIMILAR TO 

<beans>
  <bean name=“service” class=”com.spring.core.ServiceImpl”/>
</beans>

ApplicationContext ctx = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
ServiceImpl service = ctx.getBean(ServiceImpl.class);

############### @Bean ###############
> It is used at method that produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container. 
- It is used to explicitly declare a single bean in a configuration class.

> we can use the @Bean in a @Configuration-annotated or in a @Component-annotated class.
> By default, the bean name will be the same as the method name.
> Injecting dependencies : using one bean method call another
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Full @Configuration vs 'lite' @Beans mode?

> When @Bean methods are declared within classes that are not annotated with @Configuration they are referred to as being processed in a 'lite' mode. 
- For example, bean methods declared in a @Component or even in a plain old class will be considered 'lite'.

> Unlike full @Configuration, lite @Bean methods cannot easily declare inter-bean dependencies. 
- Usually one @Bean method should not invoke another @Bean method when operating in 'lite' mode.
=======================================
########## BEAN SUB-ELEMENTS ##########

1. CONSTRUCTOR-ARG: <constructor-arg> 
> arguments to pass to the constructor at creation time (i.e. used to inject the dependencies)

EXAMPLE- 
<constructor-arg type="int" index="0" value="26" />
<constructor-arg type="java.lang.String" index="1" value="Arthur" />

> Inject array of string 
<constructor-arg index="0">
  <list>
    <value>Hindustan Moters</value>
    <value>Tata Moters</value>
    <value>Ashoka Leyland</value>
  </list>
</constructor-arg>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. PROPERTY: <property>
> arguments to pass to the bean setters at creation time

> If we are setting property in appContext.xml and setter-method is not available then 
- BeanCreationException with NotWritablePropertyException will be thrown. 

## ref : use to reference another bean 
Ex -
<bean id="transferService" class="com.TransferService">
  <property name="accountRepository" ref="accountRepository"/>
</bean>

- equivalent to 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
@Configuration
public class ServiceConfig {
  private @Autowired AccountRepository accountRepository;

  public @Bean TransferService transferService() {
      return new TransferServiceImpl(accountRepository);
  }
}

> INJECT ARRAY OF STRING 
<property name="carNames">
    <list>
        <value>Hindustan Moters</value>
        <value>Tata Moters</value>
        <value>Ashoka Leyland</value>
    </list>
</property>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#### <idref> element ####
> it is simply an error-proof way to pass the id of another bean in the container (to a <constructor-arg/> or <property/> element).

EXAMPLE:
<bean id="theTargetBean" class="..."/>
<bean id="theClientBean" class="...">
    <property name="targetName">
        <idref bean="theTargetBean" />
    </property>
</bean>
- Here "theTargetBean" can be pass as value also Ex- <property name="targetName" value="theTargetBean"/> but it is not safe bcz no validation is performed.
---------------------------
> "local" attribute leverages the ability of the XML parser to validate XML id references within the same file
- error occur if no matching element is found in the same file. 

=====================================
########### BEAN PROPERTIES #########
1. class (required): 
> FULLY QUALIFIED JAVA CLASS NAME except if it serves only as a parent definition for child bean definitions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. Id / name: 
> both refer to the same thing. 
- The unique identifier for this bean.

> one name specified via the id attribute, and any number of other names via the name attribute. 
Ex - <bean id="08402018" name="manish,golu,manas">
- All these names can be considered equivalent aliases to the same bean

> We can define alias
<alias name="fromName" alias="toName"/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. SCOPE : specifies scope of the object created 
> more detail given below
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4. DEPENDS-ON :
> it is the NAMES OF THE BEANS THAT THIS BEAN DEPENDS ON BEING INITIALIZED.
> dependencies are normally expressed through bean properties or constructor args. 
- This property should just be necessary for other kinds of dependencies like statics (*ugh*) or database preparation on startup. 
> This attribute WILL NOT BE INHERITED BY CHILD BEAN definitions.

> Dependant beans that are defined in the 'depends-on' will be destroyed first prior to the relevant bean itself being destroyed. 
> we can express a dependency on multiple beans
- commas, whitespace and semi-colons all valid delimiters

EXAMPLE:
<bean id="beanOne" class="ExampleBean" depends-on="manager,accountDao">
  <property name="manager" ref="manager" />
</bean>
<bean id="manager" class="ManagerBean" />
<bean id="accountDao" class="x.y.jdbc.JdbcAccountDao" />

EXAMPLE2:
<bean id="extensionRegistry" class="com.tibco.amf.admin.server.ExtensionRegistryFactoryBean" depends-on="componentRegistry">
  <property name="classLoader" ref="emptyClassLoader"/>
  <property name="componentRegistryManager" ref="componentRegistryManager"/>
</bean>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5. init-method :
> name of the custom initialization method to invoke after setting bean properties. 
- The METHOD MUST HAVE NO ARGUMENTS, but may throw any exception. 
> This is an alternative to implementing Spring's InitializingBean[i] or marking a method with the @PostConstruct annotation.

##USING XML
<bean name="employee2" class="com.newjava4world.spring.beanLifeCycleDemo.Employee" 
	init-method="myinit" 
	destroy-method="mydestroy" >
	<property name="empName" value="Gaurav Agrawal"/>
</bean>
	
##USING ANNOTATION
@Bean(name="e2", initMethod="myinitmethod")
public EmployeeEntity getE2(){
  EmployeeEntity e1 = new EmployeeEntity();		
  return e1;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
6. destroy-method
> name of the custom destroy method to invoke on bean factory shutdown. 
- The method must have NO ARGUMENTS, BUT MAY THROW ANY EXCEPTION. 
- This is alternative to impl Spring's DisposableBean[i] or the standard Java Closeable/AutoCloseable[i], or marking a method with the @PreDestroy. 
> Note: Only invoked on beans whose lifecycle is under the full control of the factory - which is always the case for singletons, but not guaranteed for any other scope.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
7. lazy-init :  
> it tells the IoC container to create a bean instance when it is first requested, rather than at startup

EXAMPLE1: 
<bean id="lazy" class="com.foo.ExpensiveToCreateBean" lazy-init="true"/>

> to control lazy-initialization at the container level by using the 'default-lazy-init' attribute on the <beans/> element; 
EXAMPLE:
<beans default-lazy-init="true">
    <!-- no beans will be pre-instantiated... -->
</beans>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## In Spring, what are lazily instantiated beans?

> The default behavior of Spring Container is to instantiate all singleton beans at startup. 
- Lazy Initialization is a mechanism through which the Spring container can be instructed to instantiate the bean only when it gets a first client request. 
- Lazy initialization is achieved by providing "lazy-init" property to true on the bean.
 
> Lazy Initialization DOES NOT GUARANTEE that a bean will not be instantiated at startup. 
- A bean with lazy-init property set to true can still be instantiated at startup if it is referenced by a non-lazy-init singleton bean. 
- In such case Spring container has to create the instance for dependency injection.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
8. autowire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
9. autowire-candidate
Indicates whether or not this bean should be considered when 
 looking for matching candidates to satisfy another bean's 
 autowiring requirements. Note that this does not affect explicit 
 references by name, which will get resolved even if the specified 
 bean is not marked as an autowire candidate.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
10. factory-method [more detail in 03_IOC_Dependency_Injection.txt]

> name of a factory method to use to create this object. 
> Autowiring does not apply to factory methods. 

> creating instance using a static factory method, along with the class attribute which specifies the class containing the static factory method
- use for such a bean definition is to call static factories in legacy code

EXAMPLE : 
<bean id="exampleBean" class="examples.ExampleBean2" factory-method="createInstance"/>
- the createInstance() method must be a static method. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
11. factory-bean [more detail in 03_IOC_Dependency_Injection.txt]

> Alternative to class attribute for factory-method usage. 
- If this is specified, no class attribute should be used. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
12. abstract : 
> set either true or false. The default is "false".
> it is doesn't meant to be instantiated itself but rather just SERVE AS PARENT FOR CONCRETE CHILD BEAN 
> Allows definition of part of a bean which can be reused many times in other bean definitions 

EXAMPLE:
<bean id="abstractBean" abstract="true" class="org.example.ParentBean"> 
     <property name="name" value="parent-AZ"/> 
     <property name="age" value="31"/> 
</bean>

<bean id="childBean" class="org.example.ChildBean" parent="abstractBean" init-method="init"> 
     <property name="name" value="child-AZ"/>
</bean> 
> Parent bean could not be injected, child could
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
13. PARENT:
> name of the parent bean definition. 
> It define bean definition inheritance
> it SIGNIFIES CONFIGURATION INHERITANCE and not related to Java inheritance.
> A CHILD BEAN DEFINITION WILL INHERIT constructor argument values, property values and method overrides from the parent, with the option to add new values. 
> If init method, destroy method, factory bean and/or factory method are specified, they will override the corresponding parent settings. 
> The remaining settings will always be taken from the child definition: depends-on, autowire mode, scope, lazy init.

EXAMPLE:
Class MyBean {
    attrib1
    attrib2
    attrib3
    attrib4
} 
> one instance of bean "bean1" just needs attrib1 and attrib2 whereas another say bean2 instance needs all four the attributes. 
Configure these two beans

<bean id="bean1" class="MyBean">
    <property name="attrib1" value="val1" />
    <property name="attrib2" value="val2" />
</bean>

<bean id="bean2" parent="bean1">
    <property name="attrib3" value="val3" />
    <property name="attrib4" value="val4" />
</bean>
> here bean2 just needed to configure attrib3 and attrib4. The other two attributes are inherited from bean1.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
EXAMPLE:
<!-- IN THE PARENT CONTEXT -->
<bean id="accountService" class="com.foo.SimpleAccountService">
    <!-- insert dependencies as required as here -->
</bean>

<!-- in the child (descendant) context -->
<bean id="accountService"  <-- notice that the name of this bean is the SAME AS THE NAME OF THE 'PARENT' BEAN
      class="org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean">
      <property name="target">
          <ref parent="accountService"/>  <-- notice how we refer to the parent bean
      </property>
    <!-- insert other configuration and dependencies as required as here -->
</bean>

> main use of this bean reference variant is when you have a hierarchy of containers and you want to wrap an existing bean in a parent container with some sort of proxy which will have the same name as the parent bean
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## In Spring, how to implement inheritance in bean definition?

> A Spring bean can inherit from another Spring bean through "parent" attribute on the child bean. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## In Spring, what are bean post processors? Can we associate multiple bean post processors with a bean?

> In Spring framework, the BeanPostProcessor[i] defines a number of callback methods that an application developer can implement in order to provide their own  instantiation logic, dependency-resolution logic etc. 
- These methods are invoked by the Spring container after it has finished with bean instantiation, configuring and initialization.
 
- Multiple BeanPostProcessor can be configured for a bean. The order of their execution can be controlled through "order" property.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Explain the concept of inner beans in Spring?

> Spring inner beans are beans that are defined within the scope of another bean. 
- The concept is very similar to Java inner classes. 
- Inner beans are supported both by constructor injection as well as setter injection.
 
> Inner beans are typically USED WHEN A BEAN IS BEING REFERENCED BY ONLY ONE BEAN. 
- An important point to note is that SCOPE, ID AND NAME TAGS FOR INNER BEANS ARE ALWAYS IGNORED BY THE SPRING CONTAINER. 
- Inner beans are always anonymous and they are ALWAYS SCOPED AS PROTOTYPE.
=====================================
############## SCOPES ###############

## What are the scopes of Spring beans ?

> There are five scopes defined for Spring Beans.
- also we can create a custom scope.

1. SINGLETON 
– ONLY ONE INSTANCE of the bean will be created for each container. 
- This is the DEFAULT SCOPE for the spring beans. 
- While using this scope, make sure bean doesn’t have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues.
- the object is created while loading spring xml not at getBean() 

2. PROTOTYPE 
– A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested or referenced.
- its object is not create at the time of loading xml 

3. REQUEST 
– This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. 
- A new instance of the bean will be created FOR EACH HTTP REQUEST.
- it is valid only in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

4. SESSION 
– A new bean will be created FOR EACH HTTP SESSION by the container.
- it is valid only in a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

5. GLOBAL-SESSION 
– This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.
- Only valid in the context of a web-aware Spring ApplicationContext.

> IllegalStateException if we use web-application scope in normal case.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How to inject session scope bean into singleton bean?
## How to inject shorter-lived scoped bean into a longer-lived scoped bean?

<!-- an HTTP Session-scoped bean exposed as a proxy -->
<bean id="userPreferences" class="com.foo.UserPreferences" scope="session">
   <!-- instructs the container to proxy the surrounding bean -->
   <aop:scoped-proxy/>
</bean>

<!-- a singleton-scoped bean injected with a proxy to the above bean -->
<bean id="userService" class="com.foo.SimpleUserService">
  <!-- a reference to the proxied userPreferences bean -->
  <property name="userPreferences" ref="userPreferences"/>
</bean>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
### METHOD INJECTION
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
 
    @Bean
    @Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
    public PrototypeBean prototypeBean() {
        return new PrototypeBean();
    }
 
    @Bean
    public SingletonBean singletonBean() {
        return new SingletonBean();
    }
}

@Component
public class SingletonLookupBean {
 
    @Lookup
    public PrototypeBean getPrototypeBean() {
        return null;
    }
}

> Spring will override the getPrototypeBean() annotated with @Lookup. 
- It then registers the bean into the application context. 
- Whenever we request the getPrototypeBean(), it returns a new PrototypeBean instance.
- It will use CGLIB to generate the bytecode responsible for fetching the PrototypeBean from the application context.
- This is called Method Injection

### SCOPED Proxy
> Here, we create a proxy object to wire the real object with the dependent one.
- Each time the method on the proxy object is called, the proxy decides itself whether to create a new instance of the real object or reuse the existing one

@Scope(
  value = ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE, 
  proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the difference between singleton and prototype bean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How to declare scope using xml and annotation?

#USING XML 
<bean id="employeeManager" class="com.EmployeeManagerImpl" scope="singleton"/>

#USING ANNOTATION
> Specifying bean scope using the @Scope annotation

@Bean
@Scope(value="singleton")
public EmployeeManager getEmployeeManager(){
	return new EmployeeManagerImpl();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## if we declare bean with same class but different ID's then ? 

Example:
<bean id="scopeTest" class="com.example.Scope" scope="singleton">
        <property name="name" value="Shamik Mitra"/>    
</bean>    
<bean id="scopeTestDuplicate" class="com.example.Scope" scope="singleton">
    <property name="name" value="Samir Mitra"/>    
</bean>

Scope scope = (Scope) ctx.getBean("scopeTest");//Shamik Mitra
Scope scopeDuplicate = (Scope) ctx.getBean("scopeTestDuplicate");//Samir Mitra
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Is there any difference in singleton design pattern and singleton bean scope?

> Spring Singleton scope mean Spring guarantees exactly one bean instance will be shared for the given id per IoC container.
- Java Singleton : Only 1 object per ClassLoader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Are Singleton beans thread safe in Spring Framework?

> No, singleton beans are not thread-safe. 
- Thread safety is about execution, whereas the singleton is a design pattern focusing on creation. 

> Thread safety depends only on the bean implementation itself.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#### Creating a custom scope #####
org.springframework.beans.factory.config.Scope interface has 4 method
1.Object get(String name, ObjectFactory objectFactory)
2. Object remove(String name)
3. void registerDestructionCallback(String name, Runnable destructionCallback)
4. String getConversationId()

https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-scopes-custom

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## How to Injecting a Prototype Bean into a Singleton Bean?

> expectation (per prototype specifications) that a new prototype bean will be created and be injected into SingletonBean every time.

> It can be done by multiple way

1. Implementing the ApplicationContextAware interface
- instead of direct injecting bean using appContext.xml
- implement ApplicationContextAware in the Singleton bean and there inject the prototype bean using 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. Using Look-up method in appContext.
> define in bean definition using <lookup-method> element as below

EXAMPLE:
<bean id="advAudioPlayer" class="com.newjava4world.spring.lookupMethodInjectionDemo.AdvanceAudioPlayer" scope="prototype"/>
<bean id="audioPlayer" class="com.newjava4world.spring.lookupMethodInjectionDemo.AudioPlayer">
	<lookup-method name="advancePlayer" bean="advAudioPlayer"/>
</bean>
- Each time a new advancePlayer object wil be create for same audioPlayer instance 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. Using Scope Proxy 

4. Using ObjectFactory

Ex - MessageService(singleton) <---- MessageBuilder(prototype)
- only one MessageService is created by the container, it will have access to only one instance of MessageBuilder that is injected when that singleton bean is created. 
- If another bean depends on the prototype, it will get a different instance


http://dolszewski.com/spring/accessing-prototype-bean-in-singleton/
=====================================
############# AUTOWIRE ##############

## What do you mean by spring bean autowiring?

> It is a functionality of spring where SPRING RESOLVE COLLABORATORS (OTHER BEANS) FOR BEAN BY INSPECTING THE CONTENTS OF THE BEANFACTORY. 
> Autowiring IS SPECIFIED PER BEAN and can thus be enabled for some beans, while other beans will not be autowired.

> Using autowiring, it is possible to REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE NEED TO SPECIFY PROPERTIES OR CONSTRUCTOR ARGUMENTS, thus saving a significant amount of typing
> explicit dependencies in property and constructor-arg settings always override autowiring.

ADVANTAGES
> Autowiring helps to minimize  the need to specify properties or constructor arguments, thus saves a lot of typing . 

EXAMPLE: 
addressBean’ is autowired with employeeBean using ‘autowire=byType’ mode

<bean id="employeeBean" class="com.thecafetechno.Employee" autowire=”byType”>
  <property name="name" value="Davinder"/>
  <property name="age" value="24"/>
  <!--
   Because of autowiring third property is not needed to be defined
   <property name="address" ref="addressBean"/>
  -->
</bean>
<bean id="addressBean" class="com.thecafetechno.Address">
    <property name="city" value="Hoshiarpur"/>
    <property name="state" value="Punjab"/>
</bean>

######### AUTOWIRING MODES ##########
> It has five modes 
1. no: No autowiring at all. 
> Bean references must be defined via a ref element. 
> This is the default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2. byName : Autowiring by property name. 
- This option will inspect the container and look for a bean named exactly the same as the property which needs to be autowired. 
- The setter method will be used for spring autowiring byName and byType 

> if no bean is created with same name in appContext.xml then it will throw NoSuchBeanDefinitionException 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3. byType	
> Allows a property to be autowired if there is exactly one bean of the property type in the container. 
- If there is more than one, a fatal exception is thrown, and this indicates that you may not use byType autowiring for that bean. 
- If there are no matching beans, nothing happens; the property is not set. 
- If this is not desirable, setting the dependency-check="objects" attribute value specifies that an error should be thrown in this case.

> If multiple bean of same type is define then it will throw NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
4. constructor	
> This is analogous to byType, but applies to constructor arguments. 
- constructor based injection will be used by constructor autowire attribute.
- If there isn't exactly one bean of the constructor argument type in the container, a fatal error is raised.
EXAMPLE:
<bean id="paymentGateway" class="com.java2novice.beans.PaymentGateway">
	<constructor-arg ref="orderBean" />
</bean>
     
<bean id="orderBean" class="com.java2novice.beans.Order" >
	<property name="item" value="Java Book" />
    <property name="price" value="RS 225" />
</bean>

IT CAN ALSO WRITE AS  
<bean id="paymentGateway" class="com.java2novice.beans.PaymentGateway" autowire="constructor" />
     
<bean id="orderBean" class="com.java2novice.beans.Order" >
	<property name="item" value="Java Book" />
    <property name="price" value="RS 225" />
</bean>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5. autodetect	
> Chooses constructor or byType through introspection of the bean class. 
> If a default constructor is found, the byType mode will be applied.
> It is deprecated in spring 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
######### @Autowired ############

> Autowired annotation on variable/setters is equivalent to autowire="byType"
- By default, Spring resolves @Autowired entries by type. 
- If more than one beans of the same type are available in the container, the framework will throw NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException

> Autowired annotation on Constructor is equivalent to autowire="constructor"
- Here we can define required=false as so that spring framework don’t throw any exception if no suitable bean is found for autowiring
- @Autowired(required=false) ; by default required is true

EXAMPLE : 
- consider 2 obj of same type like 

@Component("fooFormatter")
public class FooFormatter implements Formatter {
    public String format() {
        return "foo";
    }
}

@Component("barFormatter")
public class BarFormatter implements Formatter {
 
    public String format() {
        return "bar";
    }
}
- if we autowired like below then it will throw NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException
public class FooService {    
    @Autowired
    private Formatter formatter;
} 

- to avoid such case use Qualifier as 
public class FooService {    
    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("fooFormatter")
    private Formatter formatter;
}

> @Qualifier annotation matches with the name 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is the role of the @Required annotation?

> @Required annotation is used on setter methods, and it indicates that the bean property that has this annotation must be populated at configuration time.
- Otherwise, the Spring container will throw a BeanInitializationException exception.

> @Required differs from @Autowired – as it is limited to a setter, whereas @Autowired is not. 

> @Autowired can be used to wire with a constructor and a field as well, while 
- @Required only checks if the property is set.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What is difference between @Autowired vs @Inject ?

>  Both serves the same purpose to inject the bean on-fly.

> @Autowired is Spring specific while 
- @Inject is the standard for Dependency Injection, specified in JSR-330.

> @Inject is available from Spring 3.0 onwards, 
- so to use annotation-driven dependency injection in Spring 2.5 then we have to use the @Autowired .

> Spring's @Autowired,  the @Inject does require the 'required' attribute.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the LIMITATIONS WITH AUTO WIRING?

1. Overriding possibility: 
- You can always specify dependencies using <constructor-arg> and <property> settings which will override autowiring.

2. PRIMITIVE DATA TYPE CAN’T BE AUTOWIRED: 
- Simple properties such as primitives, Strings and Classes can’t be autowired.

3. CONFUSING NATURE: Always prefer using explicit wiring because autowiring is less precise.


=======================================
############ INNER BEANS ##############
> Bean define inside another bean is called Inner Bean
- it doesn't have id/name. It is ignored by container 
- Inner beans are always anonymous and they are always scoped as prototypes

EXAMPLE:
<bean id="outer" class="...">
  <!-- instead of using a reference to a target bean, simply define the target bean inline -->
  <property name="target">
    <bean class="com.mycompany.Person"> <!-- this is the inner bean -->
      <property name="name" value="Fiona Apple"/>
      <property name="age" value="25"/>
    </bean>
  </property>
</bean>
=======================================
############## @Primary ###############

## What is the need of @Primary?

> It is used to give higher preference to a bean when there are multiple beans of the same type.
- if we not use this then NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException 

#EXAMPLE:

@Configuration
public class Config {
 
    @Bean
    public Employee JohnEmployee() {
        return new Employee("John");
    }
 
    @Bean
    @Primary
    public Employee TonyEmployee() {
        return new Employee("Tony");
    }
}
> Here TonyEmployee bean preferentially over the JohnEmployee.
=======================================
#### @Autowired in Abstract Classes ###

> abstract class isn't component-scanned since it can't be instantiated without a concrete subclass.

> When we use @Autowired on setter method of Abstract class, we should use final keyword, so that the subclass can't override it. 

> We can't use @Autowired on a constructor of an abstract class.
- Spring doesn't evaluate it. 
- The subclass should provide the necessary args to the super constructor.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> Spring gives us an ability to collect all beans that are implementations of the specific interface into a Map
- Spring supports injection of generic types since version 3.2.
