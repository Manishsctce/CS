> A SOAP message is an ordinary XML document containing the following elements

1. ENVELOPE âˆ’ Defines the start and the end of the message 
- so that the receiver knows when an entire message has been received
- It is a MANDATORY ELEMENT.
- Every Envelope element must contain exactly ONE BODY ELEMENT.
