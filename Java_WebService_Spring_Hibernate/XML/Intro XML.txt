## What is XML? 
XML is a markup language.

XML is a tag based language like HTML.

XML tags are not predefined like HTML.

You can define your own tags which is why it is called extensible language.

XML tags are designed to be self-descriptive.

XML is W3C Recommendation for data storage and data transfer.
-------------------------------------
#### XML Encoding ####
> first line in an XML document is called the prolog.
> prolog containing version, encoding 
> UTF-8 is the default for documents without encoding information.

-------------------------------------
##### XML Attribute #####
> it is part of XML element.
> An element can hv MULTIPLE UNIQUE ATTRIBUTE
> Attribute values MUST BE QUOTED. Either single or double quotes can be used.
> Attributes are used to distinguish among elements of the same name

ATTRIBUTES CANNOT contain:
> MULTIPLE VALUES (elements can)
> tree structures (elements can)
> easily expandable (for future changes)

Examples:
- date attribute is used here
<note date="2008-01-10">
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
</note>

- <date> element is used here
<node> 
	<date>2008-01-10</date>
	<to>Tove</to>
	<from>Jani</from>
</note>
-------------------------------------
##### XML Comments #####
 
SYNTAX:     <!-- comment -->

> Comments must not appear within attribute values.
> Comments cannot be nested inside the other comments.
-------------------------------------
##### XML Namespaces - The xmlns Attribute ##### 
> When using prefixes in XML, a so-called namespace for the prefix must be defined.
> The namespace is defined by the xmlns attribute in the start tag of an element.
> The namespace declaration has the following syntax. xmlns:prefix="URI".

Note: The namespace URI is not used by the parser to look up information.
-------------------------------------

##### Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters which identifies an Internet Resource.

> The most common URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which identifies an Internet domain address. 
> Another, not so common type of URI is the Universal Resource Name (URN).
