############ OAuth 2.0 ##############
## What is OAuth 2.0?
> It is an open authorization protocol, 
- it allows accessing the resources of the resource owner by enabling the client app on HTTP services such as Facebook, GitHub, etc. 
- It allows sharing of resources stored on one site to another site without using their credentials. 
- It uses username and password tokens instead.

> It is a framework to delegate Authorization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## Why Use OAuth 2.0?
> You can use OAuth 2.0 to read data of a user from another application.

> It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop app, and mobile devices.

> It is a server side web app that uses authorization code and does not interact with user credentials.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the features of OAuth 2.0?

OAuth 2.0 is a simple protocol that allows to access resources of the user without sharing passwords.

It provides user agent flows for running clients application using a scripting language, such as JavaScript. Typically, a browser is a user agent.

It accesses the data using tokens instead of using their credentials and stores data in online file system of the user such as Google Docs or Dropbox account.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the Advantages of OAuth 2.0?
> OAuth 2.0 is a very flexible protocol that relies on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer that ensures data between the web server and browsers remain private) to save user access token.

> OAuth 2.0 relies on SSL which is used to ensure cryptography industry protocols and are being used to keep the data safe.

> It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire.

> It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information.

> It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
## What are the Disadvantages of OAuth 2.0?
> If you are adding more extension at the ends in the specification, 
- it will produce a wide range of non-interoperable implementations, 
- which means you have to write separate pieces of code for Facebook, Google, etc.

> If your favorite sites are connected to the central hub and the central account is hacked, then it will lead to serious effects across several sites instead of just one.

############## ROLES ################
> OAuth defines the following roles âˆ’

1. Resource Owner
> An entity capable of granting access to their own data hosted on the resource server. 
- When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.

2. Client Application
> An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.  
- It could be Mobile App, Desktop app or 

3. Resource Server
> The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

4. Authentication Server
> The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

> authorization server may be the same server as the resource server or a separate entity.
- A single authorization server may issue access tokens accepted by multiple resource servers.
