#### SAML ( Security Assertion Markup Language)
> It is an XML-based framework for authentication and authorization between two entities: a Service Provider and an Identity Provider. 
- The Service Provider agrees to trust the Identity Provider to authenticate users. 
- In return, the Identity provider generates an authentication assertion, which indicates that a user has been authenticated.

SAML is a standard single sign-on (SSO) format. Authentication information is exchanged through digitally signed XML documents. It's a complex single sign-on (SSO) implementation that enables seamless authentication, mostly between businesses and enterprises.
