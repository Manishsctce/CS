#### SAML ( Security Assertion Markup Language)

> It is an XML-based framework for authentication and authorization between two entities: a Service Provider and an Identity Provider. 
- SERVICE PROVIDER agrees to trust the Identity Provider to authenticate users. 
- IDENTITY PROVIDER generates an authentication assertion, which indicates that a user has been authenticated.

SAML is a standard single sign-on (SSO) format. Authentication information is exchanged through digitally signed XML documents. 
- It's a complex single sign-on (SSO) implementation that enables seamless authentication, mostly between businesses and enterprises.



IdP - Identity Provider
SP - Service Provider
