Debugging, in the world of computer programming, engineering, is one multistep process. Debugging includes identifying the problem, isolating its source, and then finally either correcting it or determining some way in order to work with it.

In several cases, this method of debugging the new software application may take even more time than creating the program did. Invariably, at first, the bugs of software components are detected and fixed as they are used the most.

Praising them even if the team member fails to cope up with the task assigned will decrease the sense of negativity created in their mind and it will eventually increase their productivity.

Q. 33.How do you assign responsibilities to your teammates?
The best thing about giving responsibilities to employees or team member is that each individual feels the sense of ownership and take up the task in any situations. This makes them feel that they weigh some importance in the team and for the project that is being assigned. I would never order my team members for any particular task. Of course, there will be deadlines but no harsh words or scolding. For good productivity, team collaboration is very important. If the team leader motivates team members to take up all the challenges, then the project or task can be completed within or before any deadlines.

Q. 35.According to you, competition among a team is healthy or not.
According to me, team competition is healthy if it does not involve personal grudges and jealousy with other members. This is what we call healthy competition. It is healthy when we impart and promote healthy conflicts, rewards for best performance and appreciation for the rest of the team members. Setting goals for the employees leads to better competition. There should be no limitations to compete among a team or organization or competing with other organizations. Finding good competing opportunities is necessary when an individual or a team is in strong competition with other teams. Strong bonding among team members leads to a healthy and friendly competition.
